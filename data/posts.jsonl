Some plants, even those not very flammable alone, can significantly influence fire behavior when mixed with others. Understanding these interactions helps us manage wildfires better and protect our ecosystems. \ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udc9a #PlantScience #WildfireManagement #NatureInsights", "hashtags": ["PlantScience", "WildfireManagement", "NatureInsights"], "image_prompt": "mountain grassland with diverse plant species", "article_link": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24168", "article_title": "Non-additive effects on plant mixtures flammability in a tropical mountain ecosystem"}
