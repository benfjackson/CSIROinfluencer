Nationally consistent mapping of wildland fuel types across Australia using satellite-derived vegetation structural data;['Rakesh C. Joshi', 'Miguel G. Cruz', 'Randall J. Donohue'];Background Knowledge of the distribution of wildland fuels across the landscape is necessary for the appropriate application of models used to support a broad range of fire management activities.Aims To develop an automated and nationally consistent method that generates up-to-date spatial fuel type information across Australia.Methods Data from various space-borne broad-band optical, LiDAR and radar sensors were combined with land use data to generate structural descriptions of vegetation that were then converted into fuel types.Key results An Australian fuel type spatial layer was generated using the Bushfire Fuel Classification fuel typology. Evaluation against field measurements revealed accuracies of 89 and 71% for native forest and non-forest fuel types, respectively. This product provides a higher level of spatial and structural detail than previously obtained by other national-level fuel classification approaches in Australia.Implications The developed fuel type layer is made available and can be readily used in research applications. The data also have use in supporting jurisdictional-level fuel mapping for a range of fire management applications, such as fire behaviour prediction, fire danger forecasting and risk assessment.;2025/05/01;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24224;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24224
Non-additive effects on plant mixtures flammability in a tropical mountain ecosystem;['Helena Roland', 'Ilaíne Silveira Matos', 'Bruno H. P. Rosado', 'Imma Oliveras Menor'];Background Consumability, a component of flammability, describes how well plants burn and may be influenced by species traits and climate change. However, knowledge gaps remain regarding how species mixtures interact and whether non-additive effects are mediated by functional traits and diversity.Aims This study examined the consumability of species mixtures in Brazil’s tropical montane grasslands (campos de altitude), focusing on traits and species interactions.Methods Laboratory tests measured remaining biomass (a proxy for consumability) in monospecific and three-species mixtures for seven species. Traits like specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), fuel moisture at ignition (FMCig) and maximum combustion rate (MCR) were assessed, along with functional diversity, to understand their influence on consumability.Results Consumability in species mixtures differed from predictions based on individual species values, indicating non-additive effects. Leptostelma maximum, Pleroma hospita and Chusquea pinifolia, despite low or medium individual consumability, contributed most to mixture consumability. Higher SLA reduced consumability, whereas higher MCR, LDMC and functional index FRich increased it.Conclusions Our results suggest that low-consumability species like L. maximum may reduce fire severity, offering opportunities for fire management in the campos de altitude.Implications These findings highlight the importance of considering species interactions in mixtures and identifying traits that shape plant community flammability.;2025/05/01;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24168;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24168
Igniting river health? Testing the effectiveness of low intensity burns to improve riparian vegetation quality in modified ecosystems;['Elisha Duxbury', 'Kirstie Fryirs', 'Michelle R. Leishman'];Background Fire is largely untested for controlling invasive exotic plant species in highly modified riparian systems.Aims This study tested a low intensity burn in combination with herbicide application for reducing cover of three riparian woody weeds and increasing the presence of native plant species.Methods We surveyed native and exotic riparian vegetation and three target woody weeds over 1 year at a river reach that underwent herbicide treatment and a low intensity burn. Fire temperatures were recorded at the soil surface and 10-cm depth.Key results Maximum temperatures in burned areas exceeded 399°C at the soil surface and reached 47.1°C at 10-cm depth. Exotic midstorey species richness and woody riparian weed cover were considerably less 3-months after burning and herbicide treatment compared with herbicide treatment alone, then subsequently increased.Conclusions A combination of herbicide treatment with follow-up low intensity burning may be effective in reducing woody weed cover in the short term. However, fire temperatures recorded during the burn may not be hot enough to trigger fire-promoted native species germination.Implications Using low intensity burns in riparian systems to promote native plant regeneration has promise, however, integrated weed management utilising fire in highly modified riparian systems will require follow-up interventions within a relatively short timeframe.;2025/05/01;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24140;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24140
Pyrogeographic analysis of drivers of lightning-ignited wildfires in Tasmania;['Amila M. K. Wickramasinghe', 'Lynda D. Prior', 'Grant J. Williamson', 'Matthias M. Boer', 'David M. J. S. Bowman'];Background Recent studies have reported increasing frequency of lightning fires and associated burned area in Tasmania.Aims To identify factors driving the frequency and scale of lightning-induced fires in Tasmania.Method We compiled datasets on lightning activity, lightning fire, vegetation and fuel moisture. Multi-model inference was used to evaluate predictors of lightning fire. We determined the number of days annually with fuel dry enough to be susceptible to lightning fires. We examined temporal trends in lightning, lightning fires and fuel moisture between 2005 and 2022.Key results Drier fuels and higher lightning density increased the probability of lightning fires, with areas of treeless vegetation being more susceptible than forests. Lightning fire-prone areas were concentrated in western and central Tasmania. However, no significant trends were found in lightning days or lightning fire days. There was a drying trend in fuel moisture in western and southern Tasmania, and a increasing wetness trend in northern and eastern regions.Conclusions and implications Lightning fires are most likely in treeless vegetation with dry fuels and those exposed to intense lightning activity. The short record limits detecting temporal trends. High-resolution data on fuel dryness, lightning and ignitions are crucial for understanding lightning fire dynamics.;2025/05/01;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24202;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24202
Insights on the dynamics of Miombo woody vegetation in Niassa Special Reserve, northern Mozambique;['Matola Salimo', 'Victorino Buramuge', 'Aide Farão', 'Aniceto Chauque', 'Romana Bandeira', 'Jone Fernando', 'Ana I. Ribeiro-Barros', 'Cristina Branquinho', 'Natasha Ribeiro'];Background Fire is a key ecological factor in the Miombo woodlands of southern Africa, but its role in tree dynamics has not been fully explored.Aim Investigate relationships between fire and forest dynamics and predict Miombo diameter distribution for the year 2033.Methods Tree data (growth, recruitment and mortality) were collected (2005, 2009, 2015 and 2019) along a fire frequency (ff) and severity (fs) gradient in 50 permanent plots in Niassa Special Reserve (NSR). A transition matrix was used to forecast forest structure for the year 2033.Main results Fire frequency (ff) and severity (fs) classes (low, medium and high) were associated with different tree species assemblages. High ff and fs had varied effects on tree mortality, recruitment, growth and carbon stocks. Julbernardia globiflora had higher mortality rate in high ff plots compared to other tree species. Projections indicated that, despite the regular distribution of diameter, high ff may reduce tree density in young cohorts.Conclusions A moderate fire regime is a determinant of sustaining the Miombo dynamics in NSR.Implications Fire management action through early dry season controlled burning is needed to prevent the impact of intense late dry season fire.;2025/04/25;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24060;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24060
The impacts of fire use in the Brazilian Amazon: a bibliometric analysis;['Amanda Kesley Cardozo Cancio', 'Mayerly Alexandra Guerrero-Moreno', 'Everton Cruz da Silva', 'Fernando Abreu Oliveira', 'Karina Dias-Silva', 'James Ferreira Moura Jr', 'Thiago Almeida Vieira', 'Lenize Batista Calvão', 'Leandro Juen', 'José Max Barbosa Oliveira-Junior'];The use of fire, essential in human evolution, has facilitated low-cost land management in the Amazon, albeit with significant environmental losses. Its uncontrolled use, exacerbated by climate change, intensifies environmental and socioeconomic challenges. This study explores the impacts of fire use in the Brazilian Amazon via bibliometric analysis, revealing trends, gaps and key areas of scientific relevance based on 192 articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science. Brazil has the highest scientific production (58%) and is a leader in scientific collaboration networks in this area. Topics such as ‘deforestation’ and ‘fire’ were central themes. Approximately 67% of studies focused on wildfires. The geographical distribution indicates that most studies (57%) are conducted on a regional scale, encompassing the entire Legal Amazon, and 15% focus on the state of Pará. The most common impacts associated with fire use in the Brazilian Amazon are ecological (35%). This study highlights the importance and complexity of the effects of fire use on the Amazon, underscoring the urgent need for policies that integrate sustainable management practices and fire governance. Promoting interdisciplinary research and collaboration among various societal sectors is essential to developing practical solutions protecting Amazonian biodiversity and communities.;2025/03/27;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24182;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24182
Comparing modeled soil temperature and moisture dynamics during prescribed fires, slash-pile burns and wildfires;['Peter R. Robichaud', 'William J. Massman', 'Anthony Bova', 'Antonio Girona-García', 'Andoni Alfaro-Leranoz', 'Nancy E. Gibson'];Background Wildfires, prescribed fires and slash-pile burns are disturbances that occur in many terrestrial ecosystems. Such fires produce variable surface heat fluxes causing a spectrum of effects on soil, such as seed mortality, nutrient loss, changes in microbial activity and water repellency. Accurately modeling soil heating is vital to predicting these second-order fire effects. The process-based Massman HMV (Heat–Moisture–Vapor) model incorporates soil water evaporation, heat transport and water vapor movement, and captures the observed rapid evaporation of soil moisture.Aims Improve the Massman HMV model and compare it with Campbell soil heating model using four independent soil temperature datasets collected during burning.Methods The models were evaluated using similar BFD curves against observed temperature and soil moisture using standard statistical methods.Key results Results suggest reasonable agreement between the Massman HMV model and field soil temperature data under various burn scenarios and it was consistently more accurate than the Campbell model.Conclusions The Massman HMV model improved soil heating predictions and provided soil moisture predictions.Implications The Massman HMV model was incorporated in the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM ver. 6.7) with a user-friendly interface that allows managers to assess the heating impacts of fire on soil temperature and moisture.;2025/03/27;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF22082;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF22082
Numerical investigation of the effect of wind, slope and fuel moisture on the radiative and convective heating of excelsior fuels;['M. S. Sadeghi', 'Maryam Ghodrat', 'Duncan Sutherland', 'Albert Simeoni', 'Jason Sharples', 'Harald Kleine'];Background Wind, slope angle and moisture content are the three major parameters that affect fire rate of spread and heat transfer in propagating bushfires.Aims This study investigates the effect of the slope angle (0°–40°), wind speed (0–3ms−1) and fuel moisture content (FMC, 4–12%) on convective heat transfer (cooling and heating) and radiative heat transfer of burning excelsior fuel particles at different locations downstream of a spreading fire.Methods The simulations were conducted using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). The zone located downstream of the fire front was divided into two regions: the flame-induced region and the natural convection region.Key results For uplifted flames, there is convective cooling of particles downstream of the flame region. However, when the flame attaches to the unburnt fuel, flame depth and fire line intensity both increase, and there is convective heating of the particles ahead of the flames. Radiative heating of the particles also decreases consistently as the distance from the flame increases.Implications The results of this analysis reveal the mechanism of local convective and radiative heat transfer to downstream vegetation. Although heat transfer mechanisms are identified from this numerical analysis, these need to be verified through experimental work.;2025/03/24;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24115;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24115
Burning poop: chemical composition and carbon dynamics of large herbivore dung burned in African savanna fires;['C. Sánchez-García', 'C. Santín', 'T. Strydom', 'X. L. Otero', 'S. H. Doerr'];Background Fire and herbivores are essential to savanna ecosystems, consuming vegetation and recycling nutrients. Fire volatilises some elements and makes others readily available through ash, while herbivores redistribute nutrients via dung (excrement, faeces).Aims We investigate, for the first time, fire’s role in consuming dung and affecting nutrient cycling.Methods We examined the chemical characteristics of wild large herbivore dung (buffalo, elephant, giraffe, wildebeest, zebra) burned during African savanna fires (Kruger National Park, South Africa) and estimated carbon and nutrients losses from dung burning.Key results Smouldering combustion of dung led to high carbon loss to the atmosphere (C: 41% and 4.1% in unburned and burned dung) and high enrichment of nutrients (e.g. Ca, P) and metals (e.g. Cu, Fe, Zn) in the burned residue. Flaming combustion of grass resulted in lower carbon loss (C: 43% and 23% in vegetation and ash), leaving more carbon in the ash and lower relative enrichment of other nutrients and metals.Conclusions Burned dung forms nutrient hotspots with physicochemical characteristics distinct from vegetation ash.Implications Taking dung from wild or domestic herbivores into account in fuel inventories can improve estimations of fire-related carbon emissions and provide better understanding of fire impacts on nutrients cycling.;2025/03/18;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24162;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24162
Reburning pyrogenic organic matter: a laboratory method for dosing dynamic heat fluxes from above;['Mengmeng Luo', 'Kara Yedinak', 'Keith Bourne', 'Thea Whitman'];Background Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) represents a relatively persistent component of soil carbon stocks. Although subsequent fires have the potential to combust or alter preexisting PyOM stocks, simulating soil heating faces important methodological constraints. In particular, methods for estimating the effects of subsequent fire on preexisting PyOM in soil have important limitations.Aims We aimed to design a laboratory method to effectively simulate soil heating from above, to investigate the impacts of subsequent fires on PyOM at different soil depths while addressing key limitations of previous methods.Methods Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) log burns were used to parameterise realistic heat flux profiles. Using a cone calorimeter, these profiles were applied to buried jack pine PyOM to simulate variable reburn fire intensities.Key results In general, higher heat fluxes and shallower depths led to more mass loss of PyOM.Conclusions We offer a method to simulate specific soil heating profiles. Conditions that result in higher temperatures (higher heat fluxes and shallower depths) are likely to lead to more loss of PyOM in subsequent fires.Implications The method could simulate different fire scenarios to represent spatial variability within a given fire event, or to study the effects of fire on different types of biomass, or organisms such as microbes.;2025/03/18;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24128;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24128
Fire weather severity in southern Africa is increasing faster and more extensively in the late than in the early dry season;['Sílvia Catarino', 'João M. N. Silva', 'Alana K. Neves', 'Duarte Oom', 'José M. C. Pereira'];Background In African savannas, the most intense fires occur during the late dry season, when fuel availability is high and atmospheric relative humidity low. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) system has been used to measure the effort required for fire suppression and explore the impact of climate on fires.Aims This study assesses trends in FWI system indices from 1979 to 2022 and their influence on burned area (BA).Methods We employed the Theil–Sen slope estimator and contextual Mann–Kendall test to evaluate the presence of significant trends in FWI system indices during the early dry season (EDS) and late dry season (LDS), and assessed how trends in BA depend on fire weather.Key results We found distinct patterns in fire weather trends between the EDS and LDS, the LDS showing more widespread areas of increasing trends. However, only 28% of the regression analyses showed significant relationships with BA, suggesting a moderate influence of the FWI system on BA interannual variance.Conclusions Fire weather severity is increasing faster and more extensively during the LDS than the EDS. Additional factors play a significant role in shaping BA trends. Proactively managing anthropogenic fires during the moister EDS can help mitigate fire intensity, reduce emissions and support biodiversity conservation efforts.;2025/03/13;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24002;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24002
Burning from the ground up: the structure and impact of Prescribed Burn Associations in the United States;['Alison Deak', 'Jennifer E. Fawcett', 'Lenya Quinn-Davidson', 'Christopher Adlam', 'John R. Weir', 'Jeffery Stackhouse'];Background To combat losses and threats from fire exclusion and extreme wildfire events, communities in the United States are increasingly self-organizing through locally led Prescribed Burn Associations (PBAs) to plan and implement prescribed burns on private lands.Aim Our study aimed to document the expansion of PBAs and provide insight into their structure, function, and impacts.Methods Leaders from 135 known PBAs across the United States were invited to participate in an online survey.Key results Survey results demonstrate a widespread emergence of PBAs in the United States, successfully mobilizing thousands of volunteers to collectively burn more than 34,000ha annually.Conclusions PBAs demonstrated that they are reducing myriad barriers to prescribed burning while meeting their goals to broaden access to the use of fire using a neighbors-helping-neighbors model to provide training, pool resources, and reduce the costs of prescribed burning. By including volunteers with diverse levels of experience and backgrounds, PBAs are changing the narrative of who has access to the use of fire.Implications The adaptability of the PBA model to local contexts provides an alternative model of community-led, non-agency-based fire management critical to advancing the pace and scale of restoration needed in fire-adapted ecosystems.;2025/03/11;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24178;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24178
A bottom–up savanna fire fuel consumption inventory and its application to savanna burning in Kafue National Park, Zambia;['Tom Eames', 'Adrian Kaluka', 'Roland Vernooij', 'Cameron Yates', 'Jeremy Russell-Smith', 'Guido R. van der Werf'];Background Tropical savannas are the most extensively and frequently burned biome worldwide. To establish accurate emissions inventories for burning in tropical savannas, detailed biomass information is required. Available pan-tropical or global biomass maps currently focus on standing vegetation and largely ignore surface layers, a key component of fuel consumption in the tropics.Aims In this paper, we propose a methodology for building a high-resolution regional bottom–up fuel inventory, and examine the effectiveness thereof in a local scale case study in Kafue National Park, Zambia.Methods We scaled up fuel measurements using drone-mounted cameras and Sentinel-2 imagery. We examined inter-annual fire variability’s effects on emissions.Key results The fuel model performs well for surface level fuel, with an error margin of ~±27%. Accuracy is reduced when mapping more stochastic fuel layers such as coarse woody debris, or fuel layers with a structural component.Conclusions Current pyrogenic emissions models underestimate emissions from Kafue National Park.Implications Timing of burning is an important factor for total burned area as well as for emissions.;2025/02/28;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24121;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24121
Experimental investigation of fire behaviours and heat transfer in single cypress tree crown fires;['Hanwen Guo', 'Yunji Gao', 'Ziqun Ye', 'Zhengyuan Yang', 'Yuchun Zhang', 'Zijian Lei', 'Ao Sun'];Background Crown fires are among the most perilous and challenging types of forest fires to combat, posing a significant hazard to forest ecosystems and the wildland–urban interface.Methods Crown fire experiments were carried out using cypress trees with five different crown heights from 0.4 to 1.2m to investigate the fire behaviours and heat transfer mechanisms.Key results and conclusions The characteristic values of flame height, mass loss rate and heat flux increased with crown height, whereas flame width increased with crown width. Empirical correlations of mass loss rates were established. Flame temperature varied with flame height and relationships between these were developed based on four dimensionless temperature zones. Flame emissivity was related to crown height and increased exponentially with the heat release rate. This study proposes a modified model to predict the radiation heat flux from crown fires, taking the variations of flame temperature and flame emissivity into account.Implications The findings of this work enhance understanding of fire behaviours and controlling mechanisms of crown fire under different crown heights, and also improve the accuracy of prediction of wildland fire development and spread in the wildland–urban interface.;2025/02/25;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24030;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24030
Pattern recognition and modelling of virulent wildfires in Spain;['María Bugallo', 'María Dolores Esteban', 'Manuel Francisco Marey-Pérez', 'Domingo Morales'];Background Driven by global warming and land use, fire dynamics are changing worldwide, increasing fire activity and its impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and human settlements. In southern European countries, large forest fires are increasing annually and a high spatio-temporal concentration has been shown to overwhelm fire suppression systems.Aims Propose sound statistical criteria for grouping fire ignitions based on auxiliary information.Methods Our methodology combines pattern recognition and complex statistical modelling that, by capturing underlying dependencies and adapting to the nature of the data, provides a reliable statistical basis for formulating firefighting strategies.Key results Weekly and provincial data from 2007 to 2015 are used to illustrate the performance of the procedures.Conclusions Research indicates that weather conditions, the simultaneous occurrence of events and the proximity of urban areas contribute to making the Spanish landscape highly susceptible to wildfires in summer.Implications Risk mapping is key to fire management and efficient resource allocation.;2025/02/24;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23162;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23162

Factors enabling fire management outcomes in Indigenous Savanna fire management projects in Western Australia;['Tom Vigilante', 'Catherine Goonack', 'Desmond Williams', 'Aidan Joseph', 'Leigh-Ann Woolley', 'Rohan Fisher'];Background Balanggarra, Dambimangari, Wilinggin and Wunambal Gaambera Traditional Owners in Western Australia operate Savanna Fire Management projects under the collective North Kimberley Fire Abatement Project.Aims We examine changes to the fire regime before and after the initiation of these projects and discuss implications for incentivising savanna fire management.Methods Using established methods and high-resolution imagery, we compared fire metrics between baseline (2001–2011) and project years (2012–2022).Key results Fire seasonality notably shifted from late to early dry season dominance with fewer late season fires across, resulting in carbon abatement. While total area burnt remained similar, annual fire pattern transitioned from a cyclical to less variable regime. Fire patchiness, fire age diversity, and area of long unburnt vegetation increased while fire frequency decreased. A minimum of 4years of fire management was required before significant changes in fire metrics were observed.Conclusions The fire regime on Traditional Owner lands has improved significantly, enabled by the emergence of land and sea management, carbon markets, support of partner agencies, and the securing of land rights.Implications Beyond carbon credits, access to technology holds promise for sustained improvements to adaptive fire management built on strong foundations of traditional burning practices.;2024/08/30;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24092;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24092
Remote sensing applications for prescribed burn research;['Anna LoPresti', 'Meghan T. Hayden', 'Katherine Siegel', 'Benjamin Poulter', 'E. Natasha Stavros', 'Laura E. Dee'];Prescribed burning is a key management strategy within fire-adapted systems, and improved monitoring approaches are needed to evaluate its effectiveness in achieving social-ecological outcomes. Remote sensing provides opportunities to analyse the impacts of prescribed burning, yet a comprehensive understanding of the applications of remote sensing for prescribed burn research is lacking. We conduct a literature review of 120 peer-reviewed publications to synthesise the research aims, methodologies, limitations and future directions of remote sensing for the analysis of prescribed fire. Studies evaluating management outcomes found prescribed burning effective for wildfire risk reduction, yet few analysed co-benefits or trade-offs with other management goals. Most studies use passive, spaceborne, low spatial resolution sensors, characterised in the literature as consistent and accessible data sources but limited in detecting small, low-severity and short-duration fires characteristic of prescribed burns. In contrast, active remote sensing approaches including LiDAR are less frequently employed, but show promise for highly accurate, spatially explicit 3D vegetation and fuel load mapping. Remote sensing advances toward higher spatial resolution, more frequent revisit, denser spectral sampling and more data across the electromagnetic spectrum are critical to advancing prescribed fire research, addressing current methodological gaps, and improving fuels and fire management capacity.;2024/05/24;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23130;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23130
Future fire events are likely to be worse than climate projections indicate – these are some of the reasons why;['Mika Peace', 'Lachlan McCaw'];Background Climate projections signal longer fire seasons and an increase in the number of dangerous fire weather days for much of the world including Australia.Aims Here we argue that heatwaves, dynamic fire–atmosphere interactions and increased fuel availability caused by drought will amplify potential fire behaviour well beyond projections based on calculations of afternoon forest fire danger derived from climate models.Methods We review meteorological dynamics contributing to enhanced fire behaviour during heatwaves, drawing on examples of dynamical processes driving fire behaviour during the Australian Black Summer bushfires of 2019–20.Results Key dynamical processes identified include: nocturnal low-level jets, deep, unstable planetary boundary layers and fire–atmosphere coupling.Conclusions The future scenario we contend is long windows of multi-day fire events where overnight suppression is less effective and fire perimeters will expand continuously and aggressively over multiple days and nights.Implications Greater overnight fire activity and multi-day events present strategic and tactical challenges for fire management agencies including having to expand resourcing for overnight work, manage personnel fatigue and revise training to identify conditions conducive to unusually active fire behaviour overnight. Effective messaging will be critical to minimise accidental fire ignition during heatwaves and to alert the community to the changing fire environment;2024/06/19;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23138;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23138
Numerical investigation of the effect of wind, slope and fuel moisture on the radiative and convective heating of excelsior fuels;['M. S.

The process-based Massman HMV (Heat–Moisture–Vapor) model incorporates soil water evaporation, heat transport and water vapor movement, and captures the observed rapid evaporation of soil moisture.Aims Improve the Massman HMV model and compare it with Campbell soil heating model using four independent soil temperature datasets collected during burning.Methods The models were evaluated using similar BFD curves against observed temperature and soil moisture using standard statistical methods.Key results Results suggest reasonable agreement between the Massman HMV model and field soil temperature data under various burn scenarios and it was consistently more accurate than the Campbell model.Conclusions The Massman HMV model improved soil heating predictions and provided soil moisture predictions.Implications The Massman HMV model was incorporated in the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM ver. 6.7) with a user-friendly interface that allows managers to assess the heating impacts of fire on soil temperature and moisture.;2025/03/27;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF22082;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF22082
Wildland fire evacuations in Canada from 1980 to 2021;['Amy Cardinal Christianson', 'Lynn M. Johnston', 'Jacqueline A. Oliver', 'David Watson', 'David Young', 'Heather MacDonald', 'John Little', 'Bruce Macnab', 'Noemie Gonzalez Bautista'];Background Every year, people in Canada are evacuated due to wildland fires to avoid death, injury, and illness from fire and smoke events.Aims In this paper, we provide an overview of evacuations recorded in the Canadian Wildland Fire Evacuation Database between 1980 and 2021.Methods Our analysis covers evacuations in Canada from 1980 to 2021. We provide summary statistics including number of evacuations and evacuees, evacuation duration, seasonality, evacuation causes, community types, structure losses, and fatalities. We also investigate temporal and spatial patterns.Key results Between 1980 and 2021, there were 1393 wildland fire evacuation events with 576,747 people evacuated. During this period, there was an overall increase in frequency of evacuations, number of evacuees, and duration of events. Structure loss occurred during 194 evacuation events, with 4105 homes burned. We estimate wildland fire evacuations cost at least CAD3.7billion (excluding structural losses), jumping to CAD4.6billion if we include productivity losses. Indigenous peoples are disproportionately impacted in wildfire evacuations compared to the general Canadian population.Conclusions Wildland fire evacuations continue to occur across Canada and are increasing.Implications The findings from this study give us a better understanding of the characteristics of wildland fire evacuations, which can help guide emergency management.;2024/06/18;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23097;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23097
Characterising spatial clusters of forest fire activity in the Western Himalayan region of India: implications for conservation and management;['Shanti Kumari', 'Shailja Mamgain', 'Arijit Roy', 'H. C. Prince'];Background Forest fires in Western Himalaya have exhibited changing patterns over past years due to climatic change and human activities. Understanding these fire patterns is essential for developing effective conservation and management strategies.Aim This study characterises spatial clusters of forest fires and analyses their spatio-temporal patterns across Western Himalaya using long-term data (2005–2022) on fire events, burned area and climatic variables.Method The study employs Getis-Ord Gi* and Anselin Local Moran’s I statistics to identify significant spatial clusters of forest fire activity. Furthermore, time-series analysis combined with the Mann–Kendall test are utilised to evaluate the relationship between fire events and climatic and edaphic variables.Key result Analysis revealed statistically significant clusters of forest fires concentrated in low to mid-elevation regions, which comprise 27–32% of total forest area. These burned areas are primarily located in Uttarakhand and parts of Himachal Pradesh, particularly in the central and south-eastern districts of Pauri and Tehri, indicating a heightened risk of forest fires.Conclusion Identification of forest fire clusters and the assessment of contributing factors provide crucial insights into the underlying causes of their activity in the Western Himalaya.Implication Findings of this study will be instrumental in developing targeted mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable ecological resources in Western Himalaya.;2025/02/20;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23163;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23163
An offline coupling of fire spread models to simulate the 2021 Marshall Fire;['Fernando Szasdi-Bardales', 'Kasra Shamsaei', 'Timothy W. Juliano', 'Branko Kosovic', 'Hamed Ebrahimian', 'Negar Elhami-Khorasani'];Background Existing fire spread models focus exclusively on wildland or urban fire simulation.Aims This study aims at an offline coupling of two fire spread models to enable a continuous simulation of a wildfire incident transitioning from wildland into wildland–urban interface (WUI) communities, evaluate the effects of wind input on simulation results and study the influence of building types on fire spread patterns.Methods The selected models are WRF-Fire, a wildland fire behaviour simulation platform, and SWUIFT, a model for fire spread inside the WUI. The 2021 Marshall Fire serves as the case study. A map of the fire’s timeline and location is generated using public information. Three simulation scenarios are analysed to study the effects of wind input resolution and building type on the predicted fire spread and damage.Key results The most accurate results are obtained using a high-resolution wind input and when incorporating different building types.Conclusions The offline coupling of models provides a reliable solution for fire spread simulation. Fire-resistant buildings likely helped limit community fire spread during the Marshall Fire.Implications The research is a first step toward developing simulation capabilities to predict the spread of wildfires within the wildland, WUI and urban environments.;2025/01/23;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24027;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24027
Burning poop: chemical composition and carbon dynamics of large herbivore dung burned in African savanna fires;['C. Sánchez-García', 'C. Santín', 'T. Strydom', 'X. L. Otero', 'S. H. Doerr'];Background Fire and herbivores are essential to savanna ecosystems, consuming vegetation and recycling nutrients. Fire volatilises some elements and makes others readily available through ash, while herbivores redistribute nutrients via dung (excrement, faeces).Aims We investigate, for the first time, fire’s role in consuming dung and affecting nutrient cycling.Methods We examined the chemical characteristics of wild large herbivore dung (buffalo, elephant, giraffe, wildebeest, zebra) burned during African savanna fires (Kruger National Park, South Africa) and estimated carbon and nutrients losses from dung burning.Key results Smouldering combustion of dung led to high carbon loss to the atmosphere (C: 41% and 4.1% in unburned and burned dung) and high enrichment of nutrients (e.g. Ca, P) and metals (e.g. Cu, Fe, Zn) in the burned residue. Flaming combustion of grass resulted in lower carbon loss (C: 43% and 23% in vegetation and ash), leaving more carbon in the ash and lower relative enrichment of other nutrients and metals.Conclusions Burned dung forms nutrient hotspots with physicochemical characteristics distinct from vegetation ash.Implications Taking dung from wild or domestic herbivores into account in fuel inventories can improve estimations of fire-related carbon emissions and provide better understanding of fire impacts on nutrients cycling.;2025/03/18;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24162;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24162
Fire weather severity in southern Africa is increasing faster and more extensively in the late than in the early dry season;['Sílvia Catarino', 'João M. N. Silva', 'Alana K. Neves', 'Duarte Oom', 'José M. C. Pereira'];Background In African savannas, the most intense fires occur during the late dry season, when fuel availability is high and atmospheric relative humidity low. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) system has been used to measure the effort required for fire suppression and explore the impact of climate on fires.Aims This study assesses trends in FWI system indices from 1979 to 2022 and their influence on burned area (BA).Methods We employed the Theil–Sen slope estimator and contextual Mann–Kendall test to evaluate the presence of significant trends in FWI system indices during the early dry season (EDS) and late dry season (LDS), and assessed how trends in BA depend on fire weather.Key results We found distinct patterns in fire weather trends between the EDS and LDS, the LDS showing more widespread areas of increasing trends. However, only 28% of the regression analyses showed significant relationships with BA, suggesting a moderate influence of the FWI system on BA interannual variance.Conclusions Fire weather severity is increasing faster and more extensively during the LDS than the EDS. Additional factors play a significant role in shaping BA trends. Proactively managing anthropogenic fires during the moister EDS can help mitigate fire intensity, reduce emissions and support biodiversity conservation efforts.;2025/03/13;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24002;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24002
Integrating an urban fire model into an operational wildland fire model to simulate one dimensional wildland–urban interface fires: a parametric study;['Dwi M. J. Purnomo', 'Yiren Qin', 'Maria Theodori', 'Maryam Zamanialaei', 'Chris Lautenberger', 'Arnaud Trouvé', 'Michael J. Gollner'];Background Wildland fires that occur near communities, in the wildland–urban interface (WUI), can inflict significant damage to urban structures. Although computational models are vital in wildfires, they often focus solely on wildland landscapes.Aim We conducted a computational study to investigate WUI fire spread, encompassing both urban and wildland landscapes.Methods We developed a 1D landscape-scale semi-physical model by integrating a semi-physical urban fire spread model into an Eulerian level set model of wildfire. The model includes ignition and spread through radiation, direct flame contact and ember deposition.Key results Through a parametric study, we compare the relative change of spread rate from various structural properties and landscape layouts represented by model parameters, highlighting the significant impact of fire-resistant structure materials over surface treatments. Layout configurations play a pivotal role in fire spread, with isolated islands of combustibles effective in reducing spread rate, aligning with existing mitigation strategies.Conclusion Despite using a 1D domain and limitations on spatial and temporal variability, our model provides insights into underlying phenomena observed in WUI fires and their mitigation. It offers early-stage development of strategies for managing structure materials and landscape layouts.Implications Our model and findings provide insights into WUI fire dynamics, paving the way for advanced mitigation strategies.;2024/10/18;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24102;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24102
Fire for the future: governance of market-based savanna fire management projects in Arnhem Land, northern Australia;['Taegan Calnan', 'Dean Yibarbuk', 'Jeremy Russell-Smith'];Background Developing effective participatory community-based governance is a key challenge for delivering equitable outcomes in market-based carbon and ecosystem services projects.Aim To explore Indigenous participants’ perspectives concerning implementation of representative community-based governance model for the longest running and largest market-based savanna fire management (SFM) project in northern Australia, the Arnhem Land Fire Abatement (ALFA) projects.Methods The study employed semi-structured interviews conducted between 2020–2022 exploring governance priorities and outcomes with 20 Indigenous participants occupying ALFA project leadership positions.Key results The ALFA governance model, involving participation of Indigenous Ranger Groups (IRGs) and representation of traditional Landowners as Directors on an entirely Indigenous-led Board, was considered to provide effective SFM project oversight and broader community acceptance. Identified benefits included supporting local cultural fire and land management responsibilities, regional networking, collective decision-making for benefit-sharing arrangements. Expressed concerns included potential for external IRG hosting institutions to diminish decision-making responsibilities of traditional Landowners, and preference for local IRG’s to strengthen links to traditional Landowners to promote broad community benefits.Conclusions The principles of the Indigenous representative and participatory ALFA governance model serve as an instructive example for local communities in other regional settings seeking to leverage emergent development opportunities through ecosystem service economies.;2024/11/21;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24129;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24129
Short-term impacts of operational fuel treatments on modelled fire behaviour and effects in seasonally dry forests of British Columbia, Canada;['Kea H. Rutherford', ' Bianca N. I. Eskelson', ' Lori D. Daniels', ' Valerie LeMay', ' Gregory A. Greene', 'Robert W. Gray'];"Background In response to increasing risk of extreme wildfire across western North America, forest managers are proactively implementing fuel treatments.Aims We assessed the efficacy of alternative combinations of thinning, pruning and residue fuel management to mitigate potential fire behaviour and effects in seasonally dry forests of interior British Columbia, Canada.Methods Across five community forests, we measured stand attributes before and after fuel treatments in 2021 and 2022, then modelled fire behaviour and effects using the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator.Key results For our study area, field measurements combined with fire behaviour modelling indicated: (1) low-intensity thinning from below reduced potential of passive crown fire, whereas high-intensity thinning reduced potential of passive and active crown fire; (2) pruning after thinning from below did not further reduce potential of passive crown fire; and (3) chipping or pile burning of residue fuel mitigated potential of passive crown fire, but fire effects associated with chipping remain a concern.Conclusions and implications There is limited prior research on the impacts of fuel treatments in western Canada. This research contributes to better understanding the potential impacts of fuel treatments in the fire-prone forests of interior British Columbia.";2025/02/05;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24096;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24096
Simulating wildfire spread based on continuous time series remote sensing images and cellular automata;['Huajian Zhuang', 'Naian Liu', 'Xiaodong Xie', 'Xuan Xu', 'Mengmeng Li', 'Yang Zhang', 'Rui Wang'];"Background Acquiring behaviour parameters of wildfire propagation and developing firefighting strategies necessitate a precise and efficient simulation method; fireline coordinates and rate of spread (ROS) are two crucial parameters closely associated with simulation precision.Aims This study proposes an adaptive simulation method for wildfire propagation by integrating continuous time series remote sensing images with a cellular automata (CA) model.Methods The ROS in each direction is calculated using continuous time fireline coordinates derived from multi-source remote sensing images. A time-adaptive propagation algorithm is developed based on the CA model (time-adaptive cellular automata, TCA). Vegetation distribution information is derived to establish a simulation system for verification experiments.Key results The TCA model demonstrated satisfactory simulation performance, with a prediction accuracy of 92.2% for burned area and 87.3% for fireline length within local regions in the MuLi Forest Fire and effectively characterised gradual spread based on low ROS.Conclusion The adaptive simulation method produces fairly precise results and demonstrated its capability to achieve localised and gradual propagation. This software serves as a powerful tool for wildland surface fire prevention and control.Implications The adaptive simulation method based on continuous time remote sensing images and the CA model are essential for accurately predicting wildfire propagation.";2025/01/16;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24130;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24130
The potential of using magnetic susceptibility to identify past wildfires in Australia;['Annika V. Herbert'];Fully understanding the causes and frequency of wildfires has never been more important than it is today, with potentially thousands of lives at risk from wildfire smoke in Australia alone. Until now wildfire frequency in Australia has been estimated based solely on observed fire events, records that barely cover the last century. This coverage is severely inadequate for a reliable estimation of wildfire frequency. Here, it is suggested that records of magnetic susceptibility may help extend the wildfire records used, which will significantly increase the confidence level of estimated wildfire frequency. With Australian soils being rich in iron, the main factor limiting the use of magnetic susceptibility appears to be rainfall. Additionally, the magnetic susceptibility records of several sites may respond more to local hydrology or organic matter content than to wildfires, possibly owing to insufficient heating of the soil. A comprehensive field study is thereby suggested, which will determine which site characteristics have the most significant influence on magnetic susceptibility records in Australia. This will enable more detailed studies to be conducted and will extend Australia’s fire records.;2025/02/14;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24093;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24093
The influence of wildfire risk reduction programs and practices on recreation visitation;['Eric M. White', 'Samantha G. Winder', 'Spencer A. Wood'];Background The increasing extent and severity of uncharacteristic wildfire has prompted numerous policies and programs promoting landscape-scale fuels reduction.Aims We used novel data sources to measure how recreation was influenced by fuels reduction efforts under the US Forest Service Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration (CFLR) Program.Methods We used posts to four social media platforms to estimate the number of social media user-days within CFLR landscapes and asked: (1) did visitation within CFLR Program landscapes between 2012 and 2020 change in a manner consistent with the pattern on nearby lands, and (2) was there a relationship between the magnitudes of specific fuel treatment activities within CFLR landscapes and visitation to that landscape?Key results In aggregate, visitation to the CFLR landscapes changed at a rate mirroring the trend observed elsewhere. Within CFLR landscapes, pre-commercial thinning and pruning had slight positive influences on visitation whereas prescribed burning and managed wildfire had slight negative influences.Conclusions Fuel treatments can have a modest influence on visitation, but we didnot find any wholesale changes in visitation within CFLR landscapes.Implications Social media and other novel data sources offer an opportunity to fill in gaps in empirical data on recreation to better understand social-ecological system linkages.;2024/11/28;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24036;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24036
A comment on the use of visually assessed fuel hazard ratings and scores for Australian fire management and research;['Miguel G. Cruz'];Background Assessment of fuel hazard has become the dominant method of describing Australian forest fuel complexes, despite a lack of evidence supporting the veracity of its underpinning assumptions.Aims To analyse and discuss the merits of fuel hazard ratings and scores in representing measurable fuel characteristics, such as fuel load and fire behaviour potential.Methods Published findings were reviewed, and available data analysed to investigate the validity of the Australian fuel hazard assessment concepts.Key results Multiple published studies showed the Australian fuel hazard assessment methods to be subjective and non-replicable. All available evidence shows no relationship between fuel hazard ratings and fuel quantity. No relationship between the ratings and fire behaviour potential was found.Conclusions The principles underpinning the use of fuel hazard ratings for fuel assessment were shown to be unfounded. The ratings cannot be converted into physical fuel characteristics or fire behaviour potential, and its application in Australian fire management is unwarranted.;2024/07/02;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23164;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23164
Population structure, growth and reproduction in two species of Tympanocryptis (Agamidae);['Lyn Nelson', 'Paul D. Cooper'];Two threatened species of Tympanocryptis (T. lineata and T. osbornei) (the grassland earless dragon clade) are compared for population structure, growth and reproduction from sites around the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and near Cooma in New South Wales (NSW). Both species showed similar proportions of adults, intermediates and juveniles, as well as similar proportions of adult males and females. Growth patterns had a rapid increase in snout–vent length (SVL) in juveniles. Predicted adult SVL was the same in both species, and females in both species had greater SVL than males. In one year, the appearance of juveniles in the populations was later in T. osbornei than in T. lineata, but that may have been a result of cooler temperatures in the austral summer. Body condition was slightly better in adults of T. osbornei than T. lineata as the former were heavier and shorter. Longevity in the field was similar for both species, being slightly greater than two years, but reproduction may have occurred only once during their lifetime. Colouration associated with reproduction appeared to be the same for both species. Future work can use this information to determine how populations of Tympanocryptis sp. vary in response to environmental changes.;2025/05/01;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24034;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24034
Determination of population age structure from the survivorship of individuals of unknown ages in unicorns and platypuses;['J. W. Macgregor', 'P. A. Fleming', 'O. Wade', 'R. Donaldson', 'K. S. Warren'];Population age structure is an important parameter for wildlife population modelling. However, for many species it is not possible to accurately assess the age of adult individuals. We present a hypothetical example to illustrate a previously described method of determining population age structure from the survivorship of individuals of unknown ages that to our knowledge is unused in the fields of zoology and ecology. We then apply this method to data collected over 10years for a population of wild platypuses (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), a species whose adult individuals cannot be accurately aged and for which only limited data on life history characteristics are available. Our results show a lower mortality rate over the first years of life of platypuses than the one previous study available for comparison, and suggested a Type I or Type III survivorship curve.;2025/03/28;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24027;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24027
A northernmost occurrence record of Shepherd’s beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi) – a molecular identification from Exmouth, Western Australia;['Melissa A. Millar', 'Kelly A. Waples', 'Holly C. Raudino', 'Kym Ottewell'];Shepherd’s beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi) is one of the least known beaked whales. Its distribution has been described as circumpolar, between latitudes 26°S and 50°S in the Southern Hemisphere based on scarce at-sea sightings and strandings. In March 2024, the remains of a cetacean were found in the Jurabi Coastal Park in North West Cape, Western Australia, 21°48′S, 114°06′E. Heavy predation on the carcass did not allow morphological identification. DNA sequencing was used to verify its identity as T. shepherdi, representing a 600km extension to the previous northernmost record for this species.;2025/03/17;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24033;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24033
GPS tracking informs nest reserve design for an endangered raptor, the grey goshawk (Tachyspiza novaehollandiae), in hostile anthropogenic landscapes;['David A. Young', 'James B. Kirkpatrick'];We used GPS telemetry to investigate space use and movements of 15 grey goshawks (Tachyspiza novaehollandiae) in south-east Tasmania, Australia, between 2021 and 2023. The number of nests per territory in 73 active breeding territories was also determined and inter-nest distances were calculated. Mean minimum convex polygon (MCP) non-breeding season home range size of female goshawks was more than twice as large as the mean breeding season home range size. Home range size of males was similar in the breeding and non-breeding seasons and the MCP estimates suggest their home ranges are much larger than that of females. Tracked goshawks were range residents throughout the year with kernel density (KD) core areas centred on nest trees and preferred foraging locations. Movement patterns were highly recursive although some individuals occasionally undertook long range excursions away from their nests. Mean number of nests per goshawk breeding territory was 2.0 (range 1–6). Median distance between nests in breeding territories was 78.0m (range 1.8–915.0m). We recommend that prescriptive nest reserves for grey goshawks be implemented based on our 50%, 75% and 95% KD core area estimates for females in the breeding season. We provide a conceptualised example of a nest reserve design.;2025/03/14;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24025;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24025
Population differentiation in the white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) at a continental scale: implications for dispersal, biogeography and conservation;['Richard E. Major', 'Georgina M. Schlub', 'Rebecca N. Johnson', 'Andrew G. King', 'Gretel S. Major'];The capacity for dispersal is an important determinant of a species’ resilience to decline from the serial extinction of local populations. Dispersal of animals can be difficult to measure directly but population genetics provides a powerful tool for identifying dispersal limits. This study used microsatellite markers to investigate population structuring of the white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) across its geographic range. Because the species is threatened in the north-eastern part of its range, the primary aim was to identify barriers limiting dispersal. Isolation by distance was not apparent across the 3000km mainland range but populations on three oceanic islands, and two mainland sites surrounded by urbanisation, were genetically distinct from each other and the other mainland sites. The small populations that were surrounded by urbanised land had significantly lower genetic diversity (allelic diversity and heterozygosity) than the other mainland populations, with the oceanic island populations showing intermediate levels of diversity. These results suggest that although being a partially nomadic species, which facilitates its dispersal over continuous habitat, the species does not have the flight capacity of some other small passerines and is sensitive to habitat discontinuity. Populations inhabiting small areas of coastal saltmarsh in areas with large human populations are likely to face increasing threat levels.;2025/03/07;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24037;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24037
Rocky landform specialists of the Mount Isa Inlier: camera trapping reveals seasonal occupancy and habitat associations of a unique faunal assemblage in an ancient landscape;['Jarrad C. Barnes', 'Elizabeth A. Brunton', 'Mark G. Sanders', 'Christofer J. Clemente'];Rocky landforms offer a complex and persistent habitat for a diverse range of fauna. The Mount Isa Inlier bioregion of north-west Queensland is dominated by such landforms, but the faunal assemblage inhabiting them has received scant attention. We conducted a 13-month camera trap study at 60 camera stations, totalling 21,965 camera days, aimed at detecting the faunal assemblage present on these landforms. We categorised each identified taxon as either a rocky landform specialist or non-specialist. We identified 15 specialists and implemented a multiseason community occupancy model for 12 of these to assess how they utilised rocky landforms over the course of a year, and according to a suite of environmental characteristics. Rates of use of rocky landforms increased in November and decreased in April. At the community level we found higher rates of use of south and west slopes than north slopes, higher rates of use of rocky hills than jumpups, and higher rates of use of metamorphic and igneous geologies than sedimentary ones. We provide the first evidence of this unique community’s use of the landscape through both space and time and highlight broad site characteristics of candidate areas in which to focus future management and conservation initiatives.;2025/03/03;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24030;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24030
The reliability of latex weak links on radio collars used to track eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus);['Tian Chen', 'Naomi Davis', 'Pam Whiteley', 'Lee F. Skerratt', 'Charles El-Hage', 'Jasmin Hufschmid'];"Telemetry neck collars are commonly used to collect spatial data on free ranging animals. Two major challenges in application are entanglement prevention and retrieval of the collars after the study. Weak links made of a degradable material that breaks down while deployed on the animal are a potential solution to reduce entanglement and prevent the need to capture or sedate animals for retrieval. However, weak links can perform inconsistently depending on an animal’s behaviour and environmental factors such as heat and humidity. A study of disease in eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) in Victoria, Australia, provided an opportunity to test the performance of 35 radio collars fitted with a latex weak link between May and July 2022. At the conclusion of the study, 20 collars were manually removed from euthanised animals, and 15 detached in the field; all of these broke at the weak link. Of the 15 detached collars, 10 dropped from live animals due to degradation between 106 and 208days (mean = 147 days) after deployment, four kangaroos were found dead and their collars were retrieved nearby and one dropped immediately after attachment. The performance of the device in this study demonstrates the utility of weak links as a cheap and simple remote detachment tool to prevent entanglement and achieve remote detachment of neck collars during animal tracking studies.";2025/02/21;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24018;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24018

Spatial mosaics of small animal communities across habitat and vegetation cover in semiarid Australia;['Shirley S. Chia', 'Keith Leggett', 'Lisa E. Schwanz'];The fluctuating environment of arid lands drives spatial and temporal variation in resource availability and habitat suitability for animals. Patches of vegetative growth may create refuges that allow populations to persist when resources are scarce. Yet the links between fine-scale spatial variation and animal abundance are not well known. Here, we examine whether spatial variation in habitat and microhabitat create spatial mosaics in animal abundance. We surveyed ground-dwelling vertebrates and invertebrates in two adjacent habitats in semiarid Australia (cracking clay floodplains and rocky gibber), and across variation in microhabitat (vegetation cover). There was considerable variation in vegetation cover, creating fine-scale spatial mosaics of microhabitats. However, animal community composition did not vary significantly across the two main habitats. At the microhabitat level, numbers of spiders and reptiles were positively associated with woody vegetation cover. Vegetation cover did not significantly impact other taxonomic groups or overall community composition. The results show that response to microhabitats by animal populations is taxon-specific. Woody shrubs may provide a more reliable or more detectable microhabitat refuge compared to grasses for particular taxa. Informed wildlife conservation in arid lands requires investigating taxon-specific habitat and microhabitat associations, as well as the scale and persistence of these associations.;2024/12/11;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24023;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24023
Spatiotemporal distribution of humpback whales off north-west Australia quantifying the Exmouth Gulf nursery area;['Kate R. Sprogis', 'Alicia L. Sutton', 'Micheline-Nicole M. Jenner', 'K. Curt S. Jenner'];Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) migrate from their Antarctic feeding grounds to their north-west Australian breeding grounds. North-west Australia has experienced rapid development of the mining and petroleum industry, and remains under increasing human pressure. The aim of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of humpback whales across the north-west: North West Cape, Pilbara and Exmouth Gulf. Aerial surveys (n=184) were conducted from 2000 to 2010. After accounting for survey effort, kernel density estimation was used to assess the monthly distribution of whales. The largest density hotspot of whale groups was the centre to western edge of Exmouth Gulf. The highest encounter rate of mother–calf pairs was in October in Exmouth Gulf (0.0447±0.0082groups/km), which was significantly higher than in the North West Cape and Pilbara (0.0005±0.0002 and 0.0011±0.0005groups/km, respectively). The comparison among the three regions confirms and quantifies Exmouth Gulf as an important nursery area for humpback whale mother–calf pairs. Nursery areas are important for lactating humpback whale mothers as they carry the highest energetic demands in the population. It is crucial that nursery areas remain relatively undisturbed from human pressures so mothers can rest to conserve energy and nurse their young.;2024/11/22;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24020;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24020

Mean minimum convex polygon (MCP) non-breeding season home range size of female goshawks was more than twice as large as the mean breeding season home range size. Home range size of males was similar in the breeding and non-breeding seasons and the MCP estimates suggest their home ranges are much larger than that of females. Tracked goshawks were range residents throughout the year with kernel density (KD) core areas centred on nest trees and preferred foraging locations. Movement patterns were highly recursive although some individuals occasionally undertook long range excursions away from their nests. Mean number of nests per goshawk breeding territory was 2.0 (range 1–6). Median distance between nests in breeding territories was 78.0m (range 1.8–915.0m). We recommend that prescriptive nest reserves for grey goshawks be implemented based on our 50%, 75% and 95% KD core area estimates for females in the breeding season. We provide a conceptualised example of a nest reserve design.;2025/03/14;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24025;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24025
Rocky landform specialists of the Mount Isa Inlier: camera trapping reveals seasonal occupancy and habitat associations of a unique faunal assemblage in an ancient landscape;['Jarrad C. Barnes', 'Elizabeth A. Brunton', 'Mark G. Sanders', 'Christofer J. Clemente'];Rocky landforms offer a complex and persistent habitat for a diverse range of fauna. The Mount Isa Inlier bioregion of north-west Queensland is dominated by such landforms, but the faunal assemblage inhabiting them has received scant attention. We conducted a 13-month camera trap study at 60 camera stations, totalling 21,965 camera days, aimed at detecting the faunal assemblage present on these landforms. We categorised each identified taxon as either a rocky landform specialist or non-specialist. We identified 15 specialists and implemented a multiseason community occupancy model for 12 of these to assess how they utilised rocky landforms over the course of a year, and according to a suite of environmental characteristics. Rates of use of rocky landforms increased in November and decreased in April. At the community level we found higher rates of use of south and west slopes than north slopes, higher rates of use of rocky hills than jumpups, and higher rates of use of metamorphic and igneous geologies than sedimentary ones. We provide the first evidence of this unique community’s use of the landscape through both space and time and highlight broad site characteristics of candidate areas in which to focus future management and conservation initiatives.;2025/03/03;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24030;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24030
Spatiotemporal distribution of humpback whales off north-west Australia quantifying the Exmouth Gulf nursery area;['Kate R. Sprogis', 'Alicia L. Sutton', 'Micheline-Nicole M. Jenner', 'K. Curt S. Jenner'];Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) migrate from their Antarctic feeding grounds to their north-west Australian breeding grounds. North-west Australia has experienced rapid development of the mining and petroleum industry, and remains under increasing human pressure. The aim of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of humpback whales across the north-west: North West Cape, Pilbara and Exmouth Gulf. Aerial surveys (n=184) were conducted from 2000 to 2010. After accounting for survey effort, kernel density estimation was used to assess the monthly distribution of whales. The largest density hotspot of whale groups was the centre to western edge of Exmouth Gulf. The highest encounter rate of mother–calf pairs was in October in Exmouth Gulf (0.0447±0.0082groups/km), which was significantly higher than in the North West Cape and Pilbara (0.0005±0.0002 and 0.0011±0.0005groups/km, respectively). The comparison among the three regions confirms and quantifies Exmouth Gulf as an important nursery area for humpback whale mother–calf pairs. Nursery areas are important for lactating humpback whale mothers as they carry the highest energetic demands in the population. It is crucial that nursery areas remain relatively undisturbed from human pressures so mothers can rest to conserve energy and nurse their young.;2024/11/22;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24020;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24020
A northernmost occurrence record of Shepherd’s beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi) – a molecular identification from Exmouth, Western Australia;['Melissa A. Millar', 'Kelly A. Waples', 'Holly C. Raudino', 'Kym Ottewell'];Shepherd’s beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi) is one of the least known beaked whales. Its distribution has been described as circumpolar, between latitudes 26°S and 50°S in the Southern Hemisphere based on scarce at-sea sightings and strandings. In March 2024, the remains of a cetacean were found in the Jurabi Coastal Park in North West Cape, Western Australia, 21°48′S, 114°06′E. Heavy predation on the carcass did not allow morphological identification. DNA sequencing was used to verify its identity as T. shepherdi, representing a 600km extension to the previous northernmost record for this species.;2025/03/17;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24033;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24033
Shedding light on predator detections: evaluating the impact of camera-trap flash type for feral cat monitoring through in-field observations;['Alexandra J. Paton', 'Jessie C. Buettel', 'Barry W. Brook'];White flash camera-traps are avoided in predator monitoring as they are assumed to lower redetection, despite infrared cameras producing lower-quality night images thus limiting the scope for individual identification and, consequently, the accuracy of density estimates. We sought to determine whether flash type impacts the behaviour of cats (Felis catus). We identified different behavioural responses exhibited by photographed cats, and quantitatively assessed relative activity, redetection rates, and the activity of specific individuals using 11,389 images of feral cats from 62 white flash and 62 infrared camera-traps across Tasmania. We found no difference in the relative activity of cats between flash types (odds ratio of 0.90, [null expectation=1], CI=0.55, 1.47), and there was no evidence of a reduction in redetection rate of feral cats following initial detection (odds ratio=0.83, CI=0.47, 1.46). The activity of individuals was similar between white flash (average=0.026, CI=0.021, 0.032), and infrared cameras (average=0.028, CI=0.022, 0.035). White flash cameras appear suitable for monitoring feral cats without resulting in a negative bias, highlighting the need for researchers to critically examine assumptions regarding best methodology.;2024/09/13;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24005;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24005
Determination of population age structure from the survivorship of individuals of unknown ages in unicorns and platypuses;['J. W. Macgregor', 'P. A. Fleming', 'O. Wade', 'R. Donaldson', 'K. S. Warren'];Population age structure is an important parameter for wildlife population modelling. However, for many species it is not possible to accurately assess the age of adult individuals. We present a hypothetical example to illustrate a previously described method of determining population age structure from the survivorship of individuals of unknown ages that to our knowledge is unused in the fields of zoology and ecology. We then apply this method to data collected over 10years for a population of wild platypuses (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), a species whose adult individuals cannot be accurately aged and for which only limited data on life history characteristics are available. Our results show a lower mortality rate over the first years of life of platypuses than the one previous study available for comparison, and suggested a Type I or Type III survivorship curve.;2025/03/28;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24027;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24027
Spatial mosaics of small animal communities across habitat and vegetation cover in semiarid Australia;['Shirley S. Chia', 'Keith Leggett', 'Lisa E. Schwanz'];The fluctuating environment of arid lands drives spatial and temporal variation in resource availability and habitat suitability for animals. Patches of vegetative growth may create refuges that allow populations to persist when resources are scarce. Yet the links between fine-scale spatial variation and animal abundance are not well known. Here, we examine whether spatial variation in habitat and microhabitat create spatial mosaics in animal abundance. We surveyed ground-dwelling vertebrates and invertebrates in two adjacent habitats in semiarid Australia (cracking clay floodplains and rocky gibber), and across variation in microhabitat (vegetation cover). There was considerable variation in vegetation cover, creating fine-scale spatial mosaics of microhabitats. However, animal community composition did not vary significantly across the two main habitats. At the microhabitat level, numbers of spiders and reptiles were positively associated with woody vegetation cover. Vegetation cover did not significantly impact other taxonomic groups or overall community composition. The results show that response to microhabitats by animal populations is taxon-specific. Woody shrubs may provide a more reliable or more detectable microhabitat refuge compared to grasses for particular taxa. Informed wildlife conservation in arid lands requires investigating taxon-specific habitat and microhabitat associations, as well as the scale and persistence of these associations.;2024/12/11;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24023;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24023
Pedipalp anatomy of the Australian black rock scorpion, Urodacus manicatus, with implications for functional morphology;['Russell D. C. Bicknell', 'Gregory D. Edgecombe', 'Christopher H. R. Goatley', 'Glen Charlton', 'John R. Paterson'];"Pedipalps – chelate ‘pincers’ as the second pair of prosomal appendages – are a striking feature of scorpions and are employed in varied biological functions. Despite the distinctive morphology and ecological importance of these appendages, their anatomy remains underexplored. To rectify this, we examined the pedipalps of the Australian black rock scorpion, Urodacus manicatus, using a multifaceted approach consisting of microcomputed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and live pinch force measurements. In doing so, we document the following aspects of the pedipalps: (1) the musculature in three dimensions; (2) the cuticular microstructure, focusing on the chelae (tibial and tarsal podomeres); (3) the elemental construction of the chelae teeth; and (4) the chelae pinch force. We recognise 25 muscle groups in U. manicatus pedipalps, substantially more than previously documented in scorpions. The cuticular microstructure – endo-, meso-, and exocuticle – of U. manicatus pedipalps is shown to be similar to other scorpions and that mesocuticle reinforces the chelae for predation and burrowing. Elemental mapping of the chelae teeth highlights enrichment in calcium, chlorine, nickel, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, vanadium, and zinc, with a marked lack of carbon. These elements reinforce the teeth, increasing robustness to better enable prey capture and incapacitation. Finally, the pinch force data demonstrate that U. manicatus can exert high pinch forces (4.1N), further highlighting the application of chelae in subduing prey, as opposed to holding prey for envenomation. We demonstrate that U. manicatus has an array of adaptions for functioning as a sit-and-wait predator that primarily uses highly reinforced chelae to process prey.";2024/05/13;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO23044;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO23044
An assessment of dingo ancestry in camp dogs in Western Australia;['T. L. Kreplins', 'D. Stephens', 'N. Laing', 'C. Oskam'];Hybridisation between Australian dingoes and domestic dogs is a controversial area of interest and research. An ongoing canine sterilisation programme in rural and remote Western Australia provided an opportunity to assess the dingo ancestry of camp dogs and opportunities for hybridisation. Blood samples were collected from 345 individual community dogs at 21 locations. Dogs were screened using 23 microsatellite loci and ancestry percentage assigned using an iterative Bayesian assignment algorithm. A single individual was a dingo, 96% were domestic dogs and 3.5% were hybrids. Camp dog and dingo hybridisation in these areas is of little concern in terms of conserving dingo purity.;2024/09/10;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24008;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24008
The reliability of latex weak links on radio collars used to track eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus);['Tian Chen', 'Naomi Davis', 'Pam Whiteley', 'Lee F. Skerratt', 'Charles El-Hage', 'Jasmin Hufschmid'];"Telemetry neck collars are commonly used to collect spatial data on free ranging animals. Two major challenges in application are entanglement prevention and retrieval of the collars after the study. Weak links made of a degradable material that breaks down while deployed on the animal are a potential solution to reduce entanglement and prevent the need to capture or sedate animals for retrieval. However, weak links can perform inconsistently depending on an animal’s behaviour and environmental factors such as heat and humidity. A study of disease in eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) in Victoria, Australia, provided an opportunity to test the performance of 35 radio collars fitted with a latex weak link between May and July 2022. At the conclusion of the study, 20 collars were manually removed from euthanised animals, and 15 detached in the field; all of these broke at the weak link. Of the 15 detached collars, 10 dropped from live animals due to degradation between 106 and 208days (mean = 147 days) after deployment, four kangaroos were found dead and their collars were retrieved nearby and one dropped immediately after attachment. The performance of the device in this study demonstrates the utility of weak links as a cheap and simple remote detachment tool to prevent entanglement and achieve remote detachment of neck collars during animal tracking studies.";2025/02/21;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24018;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24018
Population differentiation in the white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) at a continental scale: implications for dispersal, biogeography and conservation;['Richard E. Major', 'Georgina M. Schlub', 'Rebecca N. Johnson', 'Andrew G. King', 'Gretel S. Major'];The capacity for dispersal is an important determinant of a species’ resilience to decline from the serial extinction of local populations. Dispersal of animals can be difficult to measure directly but population genetics provides a powerful tool for identifying dispersal limits. This study used microsatellite markers to investigate population structuring of the white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) across its geographic range. Because the species is threatened in the north-eastern part of its range, the primary aim was to identify barriers limiting dispersal. Isolation by distance was not apparent across the 3000km mainland range but populations on three oceanic islands, and two mainland sites surrounded by urbanisation, were genetically distinct from each other and the other mainland sites. The small populations that were surrounded by urbanised land had significantly lower genetic diversity (allelic diversity and heterozygosity) than the other mainland populations, with the oceanic island populations showing intermediate levels of diversity. These results suggest that although being a partially nomadic species, which facilitates its dispersal over continuous habitat, the species does not have the flight capacity of some other small passerines and is sensitive to habitat discontinuity. Populations inhabiting small areas of coastal saltmarsh in areas with large human populations are likely to face increasing threat levels.;2025/03/07;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24037;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24037
Population structure, growth and reproduction in two species of Tympanocryptis (Agamidae);['Lyn Nelson', 'Paul D. Cooper'];Two threatened species of Tympanocryptis (T. lineata and T. osbornei) (the grassland earless dragon clade) are compared for population structure, growth and reproduction from sites around the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and near Cooma in New South Wales (NSW). Both species showed similar proportions of adults, intermediates and juveniles, as well as similar proportions of adult males and females. Growth patterns had a rapid increase in snout–vent length (SVL) in juveniles. Predicted adult SVL was the same in both species, and females in both species had greater SVL than males. In one year, the appearance of juveniles in the populations was later in T. osbornei than in T. lineata, but that may have been a result of cooler temperatures in the austral summer. Body condition was slightly better in adults of T. osbornei than T. lineata as the former were heavier and shorter. Longevity in the field was similar for both species, being slightly greater than two years, but reproduction may have occurred only once during their lifetime. Colouration associated with reproduction appeared to be the same for both species. Future work can use this information to determine how populations of Tympanocryptis sp. vary in response to environmental changes.;2025/05/01;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24034;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24034
Movements and habitat use of painted button-quail, Turnix varius, in tropical savanna of northern Queensland;['Patrick T. D. Webster', 'N. P. Leseberg', 'S. A. Murphy', 'J. E. M. Watson'];"Despite painted button-quail, Turnix varius, being one of Australia’s most common and widespread button-quail, knowledge of the species’ habitat use and movements is poor, and largely based on incidental observations. We GPS tracked eight painted button-quail individuals near Mareeba in northern Queensland during both dry (May to June 2020) and wet (January to February 2021) seasons. We found no evidence of nomadic or migratory movements; individuals occupied small home ranges (1.38–10.3ha) and the species was present year-round. Differences in home-range size were detected between sexes and between seasons, likely reflecting the species’ polyandrous mating system. In both wet and dry seasons, painted button-quail occupied open savanna with a groundcover of native perennial tussock grasses. The home ranges of all tracked birds were associated mostly with ridges and slopes, although some use of alluvial flats was observed. The presence of perennial tussock grasses was consistent across the areas used by tracked individuals. In contrast to anecdotal reports, painted button-quail utilised areas with open groundcover (as low as 5% groundcover vegetation) as well as areas of dense cover (95% groundcover vegetation). Given that this is the first GPS-based movement study of any button-quail species, our findings provide potentially important insights into the daily and annual movements of this cryptic genus.";2024/06/27;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO23039;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO23039
Navigating phylogenetic conflict and evolutionary inference in plants with target-capture data;['E. M. Joyce', 'A. N. Schmidt-Lebuhn', 'H. K. Orel', 'F. J. Nge', 'B. M. Anderson', 'T. A. Hammer', 'T. G. B. McLay'];Target capture has rapidly become a preferred approach for plant systematic and evolutionary research, marking a step change in the generation of data for phylogenetic inference. Although this advancement has facilitated the resolution of many relationships, phylogenetic conflict continues to be reported and is often attributed to genome duplication, reticulation, incomplete lineage sorting or rapid speciation – common processes in plant evolution. The proliferation of methods for analysing target-capture data in the presence of these processes can be overwhelming for many researchers, especially students. In this review, we break down the causes of conflict and guide researchers through a target-capture bioinformatic workflow, with a particular focus on robust phylogenetic inference in the presence of conflict. Through the workflow, we highlight key considerations for reducing artefactual conflict, managing paralogs and assessing conflict, and discuss current methods for investigating causes of conflict. Although we draw from examples in the Australian flora, this review is broadly relevant for any researcher working with target-capture data. We conclude that conflict is often inherent in plant phylogenomic datasets, and, although further methodological development is needed, when conflict is carefully investigated, target-capture data can provide unprecedented insight into the extraordinary evolutionary histories of plants.;2025/05/07;Australian Systematic Botany;10.1071/SB24011;https://www.publish.csiro.au/sb/pdf/SB24011

Morphological and molecular evidence for major re-circumscriptions in and eight new species of Melichrus R.Br. (Ericaceae subfam. Epacridoideae) in eastern Australia;['Helen T. Kennedy', 'Ian R. H. Telford', 'Darren Crayn', 'Jeremy J. Bruhl', 'Rose L. Andrew'];The genus Melichrus R.Br. has received very little taxonomic attention and treatments have largely disagreed on species delimitation. The eastern Australian clade of Melichrus was last revised in 1958. Over 60years later we present new, in-depth evidence for species delimitation. A morphological dataset (90 individuals from 68 populations, scored for 26 characters) was analysed using NMDS ordination with Bayesian Inference cluster modelling (mclust) and UPGMA hierarchical clustering to detect morphological discontinuities in the genus that may indicate species boundaries. Discontinuities in the morphological analyses were compared with those apparent in clustering (principal component analysis, SplitsTree Neighbour-Net, STRUCTURE and conStruct) and statistical analyses (HE, HO, FIS and FST) of a DArTseq SNP dataset of 548 samples from 110 populations of Melichrus. These new lines of evidence form the basis of detailed recommendations for a revised species taxonomy of Melichrus including the description of eight new species, recircumscription of previously described species and the correction of a longstanding nomenclatural misapplication.;2025/04/16;Australian Systematic Botany;10.1071/SB24031;https://www.publish.csiro.au/sb/pdf/SB24031
The Dicranemataceae (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta) revisited: molecular data indicate polyphyly in yet another wholly or primarily Australian endemic family;['Gerald T. Kraft', 'Gary W. Saunders'];The Dicranemataceae was monographed morphotaxonomically by Kraft in 1977, to which the four genera Dicranema Sond., Peltasta J.Agardh., Reptataxis Kraft and Tylotus J.Agardh were attributed. All, save for a species of Tylotus J.Agardh (from east Asia), were endemic to Australia. Additions (in 2006 and 2014 respectively) were the genus Pinnatiphycus N’Yeurt, Payri & P.W.Gabrielson from New Caledonia and Fiji and a new species of Tylotus from Hawaii. General features emphasised by Kraft were similarities of apical and internal structure, zonate tetrasporangia, monoecious gametophytes and placentate cystocarps. The genera did not show uniformity in regard to thallus habits and especially carposporophytes, however, the major differences of which were not accorded any family-level significance. Two later studies, N’Yeurt et al. in 2006 and Kraft et al. in 2014, presented limited molecular data but did not treat the family as a whole or fully resolve relationships between all of the taxa, leaving Kraft’s assumption that the family was monophyletic unchallenged. We address all of the genera, both anatomically and molecularly, and support proposal of two new families, the Peltastaceae and Tylotaceae, in addition to a monogeneric Dicranemataceae. A new genus and species of Peltastaceae, Peltastanomala virantra G.W.Saunders & Kraft, has unique axial and spermatangial anatomies and an unexpected family association with Peltasta. Two additional new genera and species (Chambersius thyrsus G.W.Saunders & Kraft and Huismanophycus marinus G.W.Saunders & Kraft) are even more dissimilar to Peltasta in habit and structure but weakly allied to the Peltastaceae on molecular evidence. Both are therefore regarded as incertae sedis.;2025/03/20;Australian Systematic Botany;10.1071/SB24030;https://www.publish.csiro.au/sb/pdf/SB24030
Detection of rabbit and wombat warrens in broad-scale satellite imagery;['Natarsha McPherson', 'Bertram Ostendorf'];The ability to accurately assess the spatial pattern of wild animal distributions is essential for conservation management. Warrens constructed by burrowing species offer proxies for estimating geographic occupation. We tested the feasibility of open-access satellite-based detection for two semi-fossorial mammals, the southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), across the Nullarbor Plain, South Australia. Along two 100km road sections, we collected GPS locations of warrens from ground-walked transects (~1km) at 22 sites. Wombat and rabbit warrens were identified and digitised using Google Earth and Microsoft Bing imagery (<1.5m resolution) for each transect. We found a significant correlation between satellite and field estimates with R2 values of 0.98 (P<1×10−15) and 0.56 (P<1×10−4) for wombat and rabbit warrens, respectively. User accuracy was high for both wombat (91%) and rabbit (81%) warrens. Omission in the satellite imagery was low for wombats (14%) but high for rabbit warrens (44%). However, small warrens less than 10m in diameter accounted for 79% of rabbit warren omissions. This demonstrates that the geospatial pattern of warrens constructed by two semi-fossorial mammals can be detected and distinguished in broad-scale satellite imagery across Australia’s semi-arid landscape.;2025/02/10;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24017;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24017
Ionic liquid-assisted synthesis of pyrrole derivative: a green and sustainable method;[' Vaishali', 'Shubham Sharma', 'Preeti Jain', 'Ankush Thakur', 'Sobhi M.

Scientists are inventing novel ionic liquids (ILs) and refining their properties for use in green chemistry and synthesis, such as in green and sustainable solvents and catalysts. Owing to their unique properties, they have been widely used as green catalysts and solvent systems to develop various significant heterocycles. Among aza-heterocycles, pyrrole derivatives are regarded for their versatility in medication development and research. Organic chemists have developed pyrrole-based frameworks employing ILs as solvents and catalysts, achieving major green and sustainable synthesis goals.

Variable seed quality hampers the use of Themeda triandra (Poaceae) for seed production, agriculture, research and restoration: a review;['Marne Durnin', 'Emma Dalziell', 'Suzanne M. Prober', 'Petra Marschner'];Themeda triandra (Forssk.) is a tussock grass of international importance for its keystone role in grassy ecosystems and, hence, is often a focus for seed production, research and ecological restoration. However, these applications can be challenged by its seed biology, including seed dormancy and the variability of seed traits among populations. The literature on these topics has not been well synthesised. To address this, we reviewed the relevant literature for Themeda triandra seed and found that seed quality is often poor but highly variable, and there are no current quality-assurance standards. Seed characteristics such as weight, awn length and desiccation tolerance can vary with seed ploidy (i.e. the number of chromosome sets). Germination rates of fresh Themeda triandra seed can be as low as 5%, which may be due to seed dormancy. Dormancy varies among populations and with seasonal conditions, and a period of dry storage at room temperature for 8–10months may be needed before it will reach its full germination potential. No single treatment is effective in overcoming dormancy across all populations. The application of gibberellic acid can increase germination by ~30% in some populations. Although plant-derived smoke products can be effective, they also lack standardisation. Other treatments including the application of heat, or wet–dry cycling warrant further investigation. We recommend the standardisation of Themeda triandra seed testing and labelling, which would allow end users to assess value for money when purchasing seed commercially.;2024/08/27;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24011;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24011
Mammal craniodental remains in owl pellets provide new tooth row measurements for the threatened Julia Creek dunnart (Sminthopsis douglasi);['A. M. Baker', 'C. L. Charley', 'D. Lockhart', 'E. L. Gray'];Archer’s 1981 morphological revision of Sminthopsis included only a few individuals of the newly described Sminthopsis douglasi. Here, we used craniodental material sourced from owl pellets collected in north-west Queensland, and additional skeletal material from Queensland Museum specimens, to compile a detailed series of tooth row measurements for S. douglasi (85 specimens, 14 locations). These were compared with existing measurements for co-occurring and geographically proximate congeners, namely, S. macroura, S. crassicaudata, S. murina and S. virginiae. Overall, Julia Creek dunnarts had consistently longer tooth-row measurements than those of the other dunnart species examined. This research will be useful for those seeking to confidently identify S. douglasi by using limited craniodental remains.;2025/03/12;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM25004;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM25004
An assessment of the accuracy of satellite-derived woody and grass foliage cover estimates for Australia;['Randall J. Donohue', 'Luigi J. Renzullo'];Context Understanding the functional role of vegetation across landscapes requires the ability to monitor tree and grass foliage cover dynamics. Several satellite-derived products describe total and woody foliage cover across Australia. Few of these are suitable for monitoring changes in woody foliage cover and only one can currently describe subseasonal dynamics in both woody and grass cover.Aims (1) To improve the accuracy of woody and grass foliage cover estimates in Australia’s arid environments, around major disturbances and in perennially green pastures. (2) To gain a detailed understanding of the accuracy of woody and grass foliage cover estimates for Australia.Methods Satellite-derived greenness data were converted to total foliage cover fraction (0.0–1.0), accounting for differences in background soil affects. Total cover was split into component woody and grass cover by using a modified persistent–recurrent splitting algorithm. Results were compared with 4214 field measurements of cover.Key results Accuracy varied between woody and grassland vegetation types, with total, woody and grass foliage cover having low errors (of ~0.08) and near-zero biases across all woody vegetation types. Across grasslands, errors were higher (up to 0.28), and biases were greater (and negative), with both scaling with foliage density.Conclusions Foliage cover was accurately estimated for forested through to sparsely wooded ecosystems. Foliage cover of pure, dense grasslands was systematically underpredicted.Implications This is the only Australian cover product that can generate temporally dense woody and grass foliage cover data and is invaluable for monitoring vegetation dynamics, particularly across Australia’s mixed tree–grass landscapes.;2025/03/06;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24060;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24060
Population structure, growth and reproduction in two species of Tympanocryptis (Agamidae);['Lyn Nelson', 'Paul D. Cooper'];Two threatened species of Tympanocryptis (T. lineata and T. osbornei) (the grassland earless dragon clade) are compared for population structure, growth and reproduction from sites around the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and near Cooma in New South Wales (NSW). Both species showed similar proportions of adults, intermediates and juveniles, as well as similar proportions of adult males and females. Growth patterns had a rapid increase in snout–vent length (SVL) in juveniles. Predicted adult SVL was the same in both species, and females in both species had greater SVL than males. In one year, the appearance of juveniles in the populations was later in T. osbornei than in T. lineata, but that may have been a result of cooler temperatures in the austral summer. Body condition was slightly better in adults of T. osbornei than T. lineata as the former were heavier and shorter. Longevity in the field was similar for both species, being slightly greater than two years, but reproduction may have occurred only once during their lifetime. Colouration associated with reproduction appeared to be the same for both species. Future work can use this information to determine how populations of Tympanocryptis sp. vary in response to environmental changes.;2025/05/01;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24034;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24034
Asymmetric gait in locomotion of Hypsiprymnodon moschatus, the most primitive extant macropodoid marsupial;['Peter J. Bishop', 'Amy C. Tschirn', 'Aaron B. Camens', 'Gavin J. Prideaux'];"The evolutionary history of kangaroos and their relatives cannot be understood without considering the origins of their diverse locomotor behaviours, especially hopping. As the most primitive extant macropodoid, the musky rat-kangaroo, Hypsiprymnodon moschatus, can offer insight into evolution within the group, including the origin of bipedal hopping locomotion. Adult H. moschatus individuals were filmed in the wild to study their locomotor behaviour. Quantitative analysis of temporal footfall patterns showed that H. moschatus uses exclusively asymmetric gaits across slow and fast speeds of locomotion, predominantly employing a bounding gait. In addition, observations confirmed that it is restricted to quadrupedal gaits even at very fast speeds; there remains no evidence of hopping in this species. These results support the hypothesis that a shift to an asymmetric-gait-dominant locomotor repertoire was a functional prerequisite in the evolution of bipedal hopping in macropodoids.";2025/03/20;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24050;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24050
Factors influencing uptake and sustained utility of HealthPathways in Australian general practice: a qualitative study;['Susan Saldanha', 'Riki Lane', 'Sharon Clifford', 'Prisha Dadoo', 'Chris Barton', 'Grant Russell'];Background Formalised clinical pathways have become popular approaches to translate evidence into clinical recommendations, tailored for the local healthcare setting. In recent years, the HealthPathways platform has been used to implement a range of clinical and referral pathways in New Zealand and Australia. Despite widespread adoption, little is known of factors influencing the sustained use of HealthPathways in Australian general practice.Methods This qualitative study, conducted in three Melbourne Primary Health Network catchments, applied normalisation process theory to explore HealthPathways implementation. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 43 participants, including general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, practice managers, Primary Health Network staff and key regional informants. Analysis combined inductive and deductive approaches.Results The findings suggest that although HealthPathways holds promise for enhancing clinical practice, its adoption and impact are currently limited due to low awareness and varied integration across Primary Health Network catchments. Recent medical graduates found it useful for helping patients access appropriate care. Adoption was influenced by peer recommendations and time constraints, although established GPs resisted change. Targeted education, effective promotion and improved monitoring systems were identified as crucial to facilitate wider and more effective use of HealthPathways, ultimately contributing to better patient care and streamlined clinical processes.Conclusion Although HealthPathways’ relative normalisation is evident, challenges in integration persist, requiring targeted strategies. Comprehensive promotion to GPs, standardisation across Australia and enhancing technical interoperability between digital interfaces is essential. Strong partnerships and feedback mechanisms can optimise HealthPathways’ impact on patient care, supporting the objectives of the Australian National Primary Health Care 10-year plan.;2025/03/27;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24142;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24142
Properties and antifouling performance of fabricated polymers containing copper thiocyanate;['Krishnamurthy Prasad', 'Richard F. Piola', 'Jitraporn Vongsvivut', 'Hareem Khan', 'Paul J. Molino', 'Dominic J. Hare', 'Nisa V. Salim', 'Nishar Hameed'];"Fouling of subsurface structures by micro and macro-organisms is a centuries-old problem that can be better managed by the use of multi-functional materials and modern fabrication techniques. Copper(I) thiocyanate, or CuTC, is a common coordination polymer that reduces the adherence and growth of marine organisms on underwater surfaces used as a paint additive. Test samples of polymers that contained up to 20% (w/w) CuTC were fabricated using two methods: a two-part epoxy system, cast into moulds and cured at room temperature; and stereolithography, a 3-D printing technique that uses UV light to set designs additively manufactured from a single part urethane resin. Fabricated materials were extensively characterised by advanced X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and polarised synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (S-FTIR) microspectroscopy, which together revealed distinct molecular networking structures within the added chemical biocide that depended on the manufacturing method used. Performance was tested over a 3-month deployment, which showed marked differences in the effectiveness of the fabricated material types in resisting fouling by aquatic organisms in a static estuarine environment. These differences are attributable to distinct physical and chemical properties of the test materials imparted upon them by the fabrication method, all of which are areas for further investigation in the development of manufactured fouling-resistant polymers for use in marine environments.";2025/01/31;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24162;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24162
Plant life-history data as evidence of an historical mixed-severity fire regime in Banksia Woodlands;['Russell G. Miller', 'Neal J. Enright', 'Joseph B. Fontaine', 'David J. Merritt', 'Ben P. Miller'];Context The concept of the fire regime is central to understanding and managing fire-prone ecosystems globally, and information on past regimes can provide useful insights into species disturbance adaptations. Although observations from satellite imagery or palaeoecological proxy data can provide direct evidence of past, pre-colonial fire regimes, they may be limited in temporal or spatial resolution and are not available for all ecosystems. However, fire-related plant-trait and demographic data offer an alternative approach to understand species–fire regime associations at the ecosystem scale.Aims We aimed to quantify the life-history strategies and associated fire regimes for six co-occurring shrub and tree species from fire-prone, Mediterranean-climate Banksia Woodlands in south-western Australia.Methods We collected static demographic data on size structure, seedling recruitment, and plant mortality across sites of varying time since last fire. We combined demographic data with key fire-related species traits to define plant life-history strategies. We then compared observed life histories with a priori expectations for surface, stand-replacing, and mixed-severity fire-regime types to infer historical fire-regime associations.Key results Fire-killed shrubs and weakly serotinous trees had abundant post-fire seedling recruitment, but also developed multi-cohort populations during fire-free periods via inter-fire seedling recruitment. Resprouting shrubs had little seedling recruitment at any time, even following fire, and showed no signs of decline in the long absence of fire, likely owing to their very long lifespans.Conclusions The variation in life-history strategies for these six co-occurring species is consistent with known ecological strategies to cope with high variation in fire intervals in a mixed-severity fire regime. Whereas resprouting and strong post-fire seedling recruitment indicate a tolerance of shorter fire intervals, inter-fire recruitment and weak serotiny are interpreted as a bet-hedging strategy to cope with occasional long fire-free periods that may otherwise exceed adult and seed-bank lifespans.Implications Our findings suggested that Banksia Woodlands have evolved with highly variable fire intervals in a mixed-severity fire regime. Further investigations of species adaptations to varying fire size and patchiness can help extend our understanding of fire-regime tolerances.;2024/07/11;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT23098;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT23098
A new method for the preparation of FeIV and comparison with the performance of FeO42−;['Haoda Guo', 'Linhao Fan', 'Naidong Zhang'];FeO32− acted as a highly effective water-purifying agent and exhibited superior performance compared with FeO42−. The traditional synthesis method of FeO32− requires challenging reaction conditions. This study focused on the environmentally friendly synthesis of green Na2FeO3 crystals using sodium hypochlorite as a medium by a concentration method under depressurisation. In an alkaline hypochlorite system, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed that, under different OH− concentrations and temperatures, hypochlorite can oxidise FeIII to FeO32−. Na2FeO3 served as a highly effective water-purifying agent and was superior to K2FeO4 in the treatment of oil-recovery wastewater. Na2FeO3 and K2FeO4 reacted similarly to organic compounds as determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Additionally, it is less expensive to synthesise Na2FeO3 compared with K2FeO4.;2025/01/31;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24156;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24156
APCalign: an R package workflow and app for aligning and updating flora names to the Australian Plant Census;['Elizabeth H. Wenk', 'William K. Cornwell', 'Anne Fuchs', 'Fonti Kar', 'Anna M. Monro', 'Hervé Sauquet', 'Ruby E. Stephens', 'Daniel S. Falster'];Here we present ‘APCalign’, an R package and accompanying browser-sourced application to align and update scientific names for Australian vascular plants to the most likely currently accepted name in the Australian Plant Census (APC) or a name in the Australian Plant Names Index (APNI). Scientific names are the label assigned to unique taxon concepts by the scientific community, but this common terminology is most useful if a taxon concept is consistently referred to by the same name. These links can be broken because of either spelling mistakes or taxonomic changes. Automated tools are required to resolve taxon lists, aligning and updating long lists of possibly erroneous scientific names to the most likely currently accepted names. It is essential that tools specific to the APC/APNI be developed, because these lists specify an endorsed national-level nomenclature used in government legislation and include the uniquely Australian concept of phrase names, absent in global taxonomic datasets. To align input names to names within the APC or APNI, ‘APCalign’ works progressively through a sequence of checks that combine different permutations of the input name, exact versus fuzzy matches, matches that consider the entire name input versus a subset of words, and character strings that indicate a name can be resolved only to a genus or family. The aligned names are then, when possible, updated to a currently accepted taxon concept within the APC. This package should facilitate all research outputs that require diverse scientific name lists to be merged or outdated lists to be updated.;2024/06/13;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24014;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24014
Self-assembled monolayers: a journey from fundamental tools for understanding interfaces to commercial sensing technologies;['Essam M. Dief', 'Richard D. Tilley', 'J. Justin Gooding'];Self-assembled monolayers were first described in the 1980s and have now become ubiquitous in many interfacial technologies. In this account, we discuss different self-assembled monolayer systems, outlining their positives and negatives. We then overview other researchers’ work and our own group’s journey in using self-assembled monolayers to develop new concepts in sensing and addressing general challenges faced by many types of sensors. Finally, we reflect on some of the challenges monolayer chemistry needs to address to facilitate further use of this powerful surface chemistry in commercial devices.;2024/09/23;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24096;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24096
Understanding Rhododendron intraspecific compatibility in botanic garden collections for species conservation;['Ling Hu', 'Susan E. Gardiner', 'Jennifer A. Tate', 'Marion B. MacKay'];Context Controlled pollination is an important technique for maintaining intraspecific diversity in integrated plant conservation practices, particularly in genera such as Rhododendron, where open pollination usually produces hybrids with unknown paternal lineages.Aims This study investigated the capacity for viable seed set from self- and intraspecific cross-pollination for Rhododendron taxa in different categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, to guide conservation management of threatened species in botanic garden collections.Methods The following five taxa of subsection Maddenia were studied: R. dalhousiae var. dalhousiae (Least Concern), R. dalhousiae var. rhabdotum (Vulnerable), R. lindleyi (Least Concern), R. nuttallii (Near Threatened), and R. excellens (Vulnerable). Controlled pollination was performed on selected garden accessions, and seed germination was tested at an alternating temperature regime of 15/25°C, 8h photoperiod, and ~6μmolm−2s−1 photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).Key results Intraspecific compatibilities varied among different taxa and between self- and outcross treatments. X-ray images for Rhododendron seeds showed low capacity to predict seed germination. Neither X-ray scan nor fungicide (Ridomil) treatment showed any adverse impact on seed germination, which has positive implications for seed-banking and subsequent raising of Rhododendron seedlings.Conclusions Controlled intraspecific pollination can be used to maintain diversity of ex situ accessions for selected Rhododendron species. However, the zero or low compatibility demonstrated in some species, such as R. excellens, suggests that these species may require a different approach.Implications Intraspecific pollination should be evaluated for each Rhododendron species before a propagation program is initiated in ex situ conservation.;2024/09/19;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24005;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24005
Does tree hollow volume influence use by small arboreal mammals?;['William Terry', 'Ross L. Goldingay'];Identifying the specific tree hollow requirements of hollow dependent fauna is central to managing these shelter resources, as well as determining where habitat restoration is required. We installed pairs of carved tree hollows of different cavity volume at 14 sites to investigate whether preferences were shown by the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), inland sugar glider (Petaurus notatus) and agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis). Small (1500cm3) cavities should be of sufficient size to support non-breeding individuals, whereas large (9000cm3) cavities should be required for breeding. Camera traps showed that the probability of visitation was highly seasonal but did not differ between hollow types for any species. Despite a high probability of visitation per week by all species (0.45–0.75, in summer), inspection of the hollows showed that few were occupied. Two phascogale nests were observed in large hollows and one in a small hollow. Nesting sugar gliders were seen in two large hollows and a nest was seen in another. No antechinus nests were recorded. Low occupancy of artificial hollows relative to high visitation, and compared with the results of other studies, is attributed to abundant natural hollows within our study area. Management of nest box programs requires careful planning that should include an evaluation of the existing tree hollow resource prior to any intervention.;2025/03/27;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24039;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24039
A comparison of field and genetic methods for identifying feral cat predation events during wildlife translocations;['Ned L. Ryan-Schofield', 'Hannah L. Bannister', 'Alexandra Ross', 'Katherine E. Moseby'];Translocation programs are commonly undertaken to conserve threatened species, but loss of animals to predation after release remains a significant challenge. Feral cats (Felis catus) are a major predator of many native Australian mammals and a significant contributor to translocation failure in this group. However, identifying cat predation as the cause of mortality in the field is challenging and can hinder or delay the implementation of appropriate management actions. We compared field and genetic data collected from 92 cat predation events that occurred during native mammal translocations in South Australia. Our study found that necropsy and genetic evidence obtained through DNA analysis were the most reliable methods for identifying feral cat predation. Field evidence such as cat tracks, scats or collar bite marks were recorded infrequently and inconsistently. Relying solely on field evidence will significantly underestimate predation by feral cats on translocated species and even DNA evidence was found to underestimate impact. We demonstrated the value of intensively monitoring translocated animals post-release so as to facilitate prompt collection of multiple lines of evidence such as necropsy, field evidence and reliable DNA samples. An absence of field evidence should not be used to discount cat predation as a potential cause of mortality in translocation programs.;2025/02/18;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24031;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24031
Implications of varroa mite establishment for Australian plants and their persistence;['Tom Le Breton', 'Amy-Marie Gilpin', 'Chantelle Doyle', 'Mark K.J. Ooi'];The European honeybee (Apis mellifera) is a highly abundant introduced pollinator with widely established feral populations across a large proportion of Australia. Both managed and feral populations contribute significantly to the pollination of many native plant species but have also disrupted native plant-pollinator dynamics. Varroa mite (Varroa destructor), a parasite associated with the collapse of feral or unmanaged European honeybee populations globally, has recently become established in Australia and will inevitably spread across the country. If feral honeybee populations decline significantly, there may be a range of effects on Australian native plant species, including pollination dynamics and seed set. This would have potential implications for the risks faced by native species, particularly those already threatened. However, the exact effects of a decline in feral honeybees on native plants are uncertain as the role of honeybees in Australian ecosystems is poorly understood. We identify potential consequences of the spread of varroa mite and highlight the large knowledge gaps that currently limit our understanding of the subsequent impacts on the Australian flora.;2025/03/11;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24020;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24020
Mental health consumers and primary care providers co-designing improvements and innovations: a scoping review;['Kathryn Thorburn', 'Bani Aadam', 'Shifra Waks', 'Brett Bellingham', 'Mark F. Harris', 'Karen R. Fisher', 'Catherine Spooner'];Co-design and co-production are increasingly used to improve and innovate healthcare practices and services to better address people’s healthcare needs. Mental health consumers, especially people diagnosed with serious mental illness, experience considerable health disparities and barriers to primary care, while primary care providers experience barriers to addressing the healthcare needs of people diagnosed with serious mental illness. Both mental health consumers and primary care providers bring knowledge and expertise to improving mental health consumers’ health care. This scoping review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was undertaken to determine the extent and scope of co-design and co-production involving mental health consumers and primary care providers to address mental health consumers’ healthcare needs. The review also sought to determine factors that enable or limit co-design and co-production involving mental health consumers and primary care providers. Twelve studies and reports of co-design and co-production involving mental health consumers and primary care providers were identified by the review. These studies showed that co-design and co-production were feasible and beneficial, and that there was significant scope for collaboration at the intersection of mental health and primary care services. Lessons learned from projects that have led the way include the need for (1) co-design/co-production practices that sustain equitable participation and address inevitable power imbalances when service users and service providers work together, (2) sufficient reporting on methods to ascertain claims of co-design/co-production and allow replication of these methods in similar healthcare improvement projects, and (3) co-design/co-production projects to be supported by other systems change strategies.;2025/03/06;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24104;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24104
A near-complete dataset of plant growth form, life history, and woodiness for all Australian plants;['Elizabeth H. Wenk', 'David Coleman', 'Rachael V. Gallagher', 'Daniel S. Falster'];Tabular records of plant-trait data are essential for diverse research purposes. Here we present scorings for a trio of core plant traits, plant growth form, woodiness and life history, for nearly all (>99%) accepted taxon concepts included in the Australian Plant Census (APC). This dataset is predominantly derived from Australia’s state and national floras, supplemented by the taxonomic literature and diverse web resources. In total, 29,993 species and infraspecific taxa were scored for plant growth form, 30,279 for woodiness and 30,056 for life history, with taxa scored as displaying a single or multiple trait values, as appropriate. We provide sample R code that shows how to access and interrogate the dataset. This resource will enable rapid assessment of plant responses to disturbance events and new biogeographic analyses of trait distributions, better understandings of evolutionary trajectories, and ecological strategies.;2024/06/13;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT23111;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT23111
Perceptions and willingness concerning the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data in Australian healthcare services;['Daniel Demant', 'Paul Byron', 'Deborah Debono', 'Suneel Jethani', 'Beth Goldblatt', 'Michael Thomson', 'Jo (River) River'];Background Despite growing recognition of the importance of collecting sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data to improve healthcare access and equity for LGBTQA+ populations, uncertainty remains around how these data are collected, their perceived importance and individuals’ willingness to disclose such information in healthcare settings. The aim of this study was to understand perceptions of the collection of data on sexual orientation and gender identity in healthcare settings across Australia, and individuals’ willingness to provide this data.Methods A cross-sectional online survey of 657 Australian residents was conducted to assess participants’ attitudes towards SOGI data in healthcare settings, along with preferences for methods to collect these data. Statistical analyses included ANCOVA, Chi-squared tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.Results Participants generally recognised the importance of the collection of basic demographic data to support the provision of health services. Willingness to share SOGI data varied, with significant differences noted across gender, sexual orientation and cultural backgrounds. LGBTQA+ participants expressed greater willingness to provide SOGI data, but only in contextually appropriate situations, and preferred more inclusive data collection methods.Conclusions The study shows a context-dependent willingness to provide SOGI data in health care, underscoring the need for sensitive data collection methods. Insights into SOGI data collection attitudes are vital for developing inclusive and respectful healthcare practices. Improved SOGI data collection can enrich healthcare outcomes for diverse groups, informing public health policies and practices tailored to LGBTQA+ needs.;2025/03/13;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24178;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24178
Investigation of free-living highland wild dogs near Grasberg Gold Mine, Papua Province, Indonesia;['James K. McIntyre', 'Caitlin J. Curry', 'Lisa L. Wolf', 'Hendra K. Maury', 'Leonardo A. Numberi', 'Suriani Surbakti', 'Brian W. Davis'];Following reports of free-living wild dogs, Canis sp., resembling the descriptions and behaviours of New Guinea singing dogs in the Puncak Jaya area in 2015, a three-phase assessment was conducted in three expeditions occurring in 2016, 2018, and 2022. The goals of these studies were to determine the incidence, status, and natural history of wild dogs near the Grasberg Gold Mine in Papua Province, Indonesia. The assessments identified the existence of Highland wild dogs (HWD) through indirect and direct observations by using trail cameras and field observation. Additional quantitative information about their behaviour and morphology were collected through the capture of eight dogs. The captured dogs underwent comprehensive medical examinations, and biological samples were collected for genomic analyses to determine the genetic relationship between HWD and other canines. Additionally, four of the dogs were equipped with global positioning system (GPS) collars to study the ranging behaviour of HWD for the first time. Documenting the existence of HWD has further strengthened the establishment of Papua’s position as one of the world’s megadiverse regions.;2025/05/29;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM23047;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM23047
Culturally safe physiotherapy care: how this looks and feels for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples;['Curtley Nelson', 'Roma Forbes', 'Allison Mandrusiak'];"Background Understanding the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as healthcare recipients is essential for delivering culturally safe physiotherapy care; however, the literature inadequately explores these experiences. This study aimed to explore the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who have engaged with physiotherapists and understand their perspectives on how physiotherapists can provide culturally safe care in the community.Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with adult (aged >18years) self-identified Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (n=12) who had received physiotherapy care within a community setting within the previous 3months. A First Nations methodology approach alongside reflexive thematic analysis was used to interpret the data.Results Four themes were generated: (1) building trust through yarning; (2) acknowledging and respecting culture; (3) creating a culturally safe environment; and (4) the importance of professional training.Conclusions Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have expressed that physiotherapists can establish trust with their patients by dedicating time to develop a therapeutic relationship and by demonstrating respect for their culture. It is essential for physiotherapists to carefully consider the physical environment in which they deliver care to ensure it is welcoming and culturally safe for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Physiotherapists should undertake professional development to immerse themselves in First Nations culture and history through connecting with community. This study offers insights into the lived experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples receiving care in the community and provides recommendations that may assist physiotherapists, alongside other community-based health professionals, to provide culturally safe care.";2025/01/14;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24137;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24137
New opportunities for molecular photoswitches as wearable ultraviolet radiation dosimeters;['Lauren E. Blackwell', 'Sandra Wiedbrauk', 'Nathan R. B. Boase'];Australians have the highest incidence of melanoma globally, despite increasing awareness of the risks of excessive sun exposure. Although excess ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can cause irreparable cell damage and lead to cancer, some exposure is vital to maintain bodily processes such as vitamin D production. For an individual, finding the balance between healthy exposure and skin damage is largely guesswork. The ability to provide a simple, individualised indicator of cumulative UVR dosage could be transformative in preventing skin cancer. This review will provide a brief overview of the variety of UVR sensor technologies and explain the important role of colourimetric dosimeters. The chemistry behind some recent examples of colourimetric dosimeters will be discussed, identifying that molecular photoswitches are ideal candidates to enable this technology. We discuss the chemical mechanisms of photoswitches and how to modify their chemical structure to optimise their properties for use as dosimeters. Through this lens, diarylethenes have been identified as prime dosimeter candidates, owing to their sensitivity, stability, adaptability and the variety of visually striking colours possible. Finally, some specific challenges are identified in the design and fabrication of personalised colourimetric dosimeters that can equitably meet the requirements of all users in our community.;2024/10/08;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH23211;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH23211
Codesigning a Community Health Navigator program to assist patients to transition from hospital to community;['Mark F. Harris', 'An Tran', 'Mamta Porwal', 'Parisa Aslani', 'John Cullen', 'Anthony Brown', 'Elizabeth Harris', 'Ben Harris-Roxas', 'Fiona Doolan-Noble', 'Sara Javanparast', 'Michael Wright', 'Richard Osborne', 'Regina Osten'];Background This study aimed to identify the potential roles for Community Health Navigators (CHNs) in addressing problems faced by patients on discharge from hospital to the community, and attitudes and factors which may influence their adoption.Methods Twenty-six qualitative interviews and an online codesign workshop were conducted with patients, nurses, general practice staff, health service managers, community health workers, general practitioners, medical specialists, and pharmacists in the Sydney Local Health District. Qualitative themes from the interviews and workshop transcripts were analysed inductively and subsequently grouped according to a socio-ecological model.Results CHNs could assist patients to navigate non-clinical problems experienced by patients on discharge through assessing needs, establishing trust, providing social and emotional support that is culturally and linguistically appropriate, engaging family and carers, supporting medication adherence, and helping to arrange and attend follow up health and other appointments. Important factors for the success of the CHNs in the performance and sustainability of their roles were the need to establish effective communication and trust with other healthcare team members, be accepted by patients, have access to information about referral and support services, receive formal recognition of their training and experience, and be supported by appropriate supervision.Conclusions This study was unique in exploring the potential role of CHNs in addressing problems faced by patients on discharge from Australian hospitals and the factors influencing their adoption. It informed training and supervision needs and further research to evaluate CHNs’ effectiveness and the acceptance of their role within the healthcare team.;2024/09/19;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24042;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24042
How soil fungal communities respond to invasive plant species treatments in soil from Banksia woodland, south-western Australia;['Aaron J. Brace', 'Katinka X. Ruthrof', 'Joseph B. Fontaine', 'Ben P. Miller', 'Anna J. M. Hopkins'];Context Invasive plants are one of the most significant threats to woodlands globally. Methods of invasive plant control include manual removal and herbicide application. While the impacts of control methods on invasive and off-target native plant species are often explored, the impacts on below-ground organisms, such as fungi, are less well understood.Aims We conducted a glasshouse trial to investigate the responses of soil fungal communities to herbicides and manual removal that are used to control common invasive plant species in Banksia woodland in south-western Australia.Methods Broad spectrum (glyphosate and pelargonic acid) and grass-specific (fluazifop-p-butyl) herbicides were separately applied to pots containing either Ehrharta calycina, a key invasive grass species or Eucalyptus todtiana, a native woodland tree at the recommended woodland rate. After sixweeks, samples of treated soils were subjected to high throughput sequencing to determine fungal community diversity, richness, relative abundance, composition and putative ecosystem function.Key results Pelargonic acid induced the widest range of changes including decreased fungal richness and Shannon diversity but all herbicides affected community composition. Within functional groups, fluazifop-p-butyl led to a significant decrease of symbiotrophs in the mycorrhizal species.Conclusions We show that invasive species management, in the manner applied, can lead to immediate changes in fungal community composition.Implications Observed patterns require further exploration, particularly repeat testing under different environmental conditions, to better determine the impact and mode of action of herbicides on below-ground organisms. The functional changes in the soil fungal community could further disturb the soil fungal community and complicate subsequent management considerations.;2025/05/13;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24083;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24083
The assembly of the vegetation near the treeline during the Late Glacial and Holocene in south-central Tasmania;['G. A. Astorga', 'G. J. Jordan', 'A. Martel-Cea'];Context In Tasmania, most glacial pollen records suggest treeless conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), but molecular evidence points to glacial survival of tree species in unexpected refugia. Plant macrofossils can help clarify whether woody species survived in local microrefugia or tracked their climatic preferences across the landscape.Aims This study investigates vegetation changes near the treeline in south-central Tasmania to understand species survival, dispersal, and community assembly during the Late Glacial–Holocene transition.Methods We used the analysis of plant macrofossils from Lake Dobson (1034masl) to reconstruct vegetation changes over the past 15,000years.Key results Our findings show that alpine conifers were present in the subalpine area of Lake Dobson by c. 15thousand calibrated years before present (calkyr BP) and probably assembled from local microrefugia. Although present in the Late Glacial, species such as Nothofagus cunninghamii increased with the onset of warmer climates in the early Holocene. In contrast, subalpine eucalypts appeared later, c. 8calkyr BP. Overall, the results imply that the modern configuration of the vegetation, i.e. Eucalyptus open woodlands, was not reached before ~6calkyr BP.Conclusions This study has highlighted the variability in plant responses and community assembly during the Late Glacial–Holocene transition, a period of significant environmental change that is not yet well understood in the southern hemisphere.Implications Treeline investigations spanning the transition from late-glacial to interglacial conditions allow us to understand how fast plant species responded to past environmental fluctuations and how species may respond to projected climate change.;2025/05/29;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24082;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24082
Ring-expansion reactions of Cyrene and derivatives with ethyl diazoacetate;['Johannes Puschnig', 'Oscar Lamb', 'Christopher J. Sumby', 'Ben W. Greatrex'];The ring expansion and homologation of the biomass derivative Cyrene (6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-4-one) has been developed by Lewis-acid promoted reactions with ethyl diazoacetate. Insertion into the C3–C4 bond gave a ring-expanded β-ketoester regioisomer as an equilibrating mixture of diastereomers, which was subjected to a one-pot hydrolysis and decarboxylation to give the 7,9-dioxabicyclo[4.2.1]nonan-5-one system (homocyrene). The reactivity of homocyrene was then investigated in a series of transformations known for the parent 6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-4-one system, including the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation affording S-6-(hydroxymethyl)pyran-2-one, which has been used for the synthesis of jasmine lactone, and another one-carbon ring expansion. The ring-expansion process for Cyrene could be used to prepare chiral C6 and C7 synthons on scale from biomass.;2025/05/12;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24163;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24163
A population viability analysis of K’gari (Fraser Island) wongari (dingoes);['Robert Appleby', 'Bradley P. Smith', 'Darryl Jones', 'Gabriel Conroy', 'Linda Behrendorff'];Small, isolated populations such as those found on islands are at an increased risk of extinction. This includes K’gari (Fraser Island) wongari (dingoes). Although aspects of wongari ecology and behaviour are well documented, much about population dynamics remains uncertain. Even where relevant research has been conducted (e.g. population abundance), results remain equivocal. We conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) to investigate the influence of different abundance estimates, along with variable rates of mortality, carrying capacity, catastrophes and breeding success on extinction probability. In favourable, undisturbed conditions, modelling showed a high probability of population persistence over 50 and 100years. Consistently high levels of mortality resulted in increased extinction probabilities, especially at low- and mid-level population sizes. Promiscuous breeding behaviour, higher female breeding success, and higher male availability reduced extinction probabilities. Our approach demonstrated the utility of population viability analysis for identifying important factors that meaningfully contribute to wongari extinction risk. However, inferences and actionable recommendations for managers were limited owing to a paucity of information for certain, critical parameters. Our findings highlighted the need for better data on wongari reproduction and mortality to help fill significant knowledge gaps required to accurately predict the long-term survival of this iconic population.;2025/02/20;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM23009;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM23009
Bayesian approaches to assigning the source of an odour detected by an electronic nose;['D. Brynn Hibbert'];After a brief review of electronic nose technology, the use of an Australian electronic nose to identify an unknown odour out of a set of known odours is described. Multivariate supervised learning is accomplished by applying Bayes’ theorem to data from metal oxide semiconductor sensors responding to each of a number of target odours. An odour from an unknown source is then assigned a probability of membership of each of the training sets by applying either a Naïve Bayes algorithm to the deemed independent data from each sensor, or to a multinormal distribution of the data. A flat prior (equal probabilities of each outcome) is usually adopted, but for particular situations where one odour is known to predominate, then suitably weighted priors can be used. A source ‘none of the above’, which has a small likelihood covering the space of the possible sensor responses, is included for completeness. This also avoids the assignment to a source that has an extremely small probability but which is greater than that of any other source. Examples are given of a single source (detecting diabetes from a patient’s breath), and three sources of unpleasant odours in a meat processing plant.;2024/09/18;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24053;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24053
Social affiliation among sub-adult male koalas in a high-density population;['Darcy J. Watchorn'];Koalas are generally considered to be a solitary species. However, during observations of free-ranging koalas in a high-density population, sub-adult males (3.5–5.5years) were seen engaging in affiliative behaviours, including grooming, genital sniffing, and vocalising. These interactions were exclusive to males of this age group and are likely a result of the unusually high population density. In such populations, where home range overlap is common, these behaviours may help reduce stress, establish dominance hierarchies, and reduce conflict through familiarisation.;2025/01/30;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24033;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24033
Ageing with chronic conditions and older persons’ experience of social connections: a qualitative descriptive study;['Cristina Thompson', 'Elizabeth Halcomb', 'Malcolm Masso', 'Amy Montgomery'];Background Chronic conditions may limit older peoples’ social engagement and wellbeing. Reduced social connections can result in loneliness and social isolation. This study aimed to explore the experience of social connection in older people living with chronic conditions, and the factors influencing their social participation.Methods A purposive sample of 19 community-dwelling older Australians (mean age 75.5years) with one or more chronic conditions participated in a qualitative descriptive study. Semi-structured interviews explored participants’ perceptions of their social connections and the potential impact of their chronic conditions. Views about the role of general practice in supporting older persons’ wellbeing were discussed. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis.Results Five themes were identified: (1) the experience of loneliness, (2) managing diminishing social contacts, (3) living with chronic conditions, (4) barriers to social connection, and (5) facilitators of social connection. Participants felt that ageing with chronic conditions contributed to loss of function and independence, which limited social connections, and increased loneliness and social isolation. Barriers to social connections included issues with mobility, transport and forming new networks. Families were a primary support, with continued community engagement and general practice support crucial to staying well and socially connected.Conclusions Understanding older peoples’ experiences, and the barriers and facilitators of social connections can guide clinicians’ interventions. General practice is a promising intervention point because of its high use by those with chronic conditions to stay well. General practice nurses are well-placed to collaboratively address the barriers older people face in maintaining social connections.;2024/07/04;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24019;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24019
Plant competition reshapes nitrogen utilisation in native Vachellia nilotica (Fabaceae);['Anathi Magadlela', 'Zinhle Lembede', 'Zivanai Tsvuura', 'Naledi Zama', 'Nqobile Motsomane', 'María A. Pérez-Fernández'];Context Vachellia nilotica (Benth.) Kyal. & Boatwr is a leguminous species subjected to competition from co-occurring grassland species in mesic grasslands, including Themeda triandra Forssk. In South Africa, Vachellia nilotica enhances soil nitrogen in nutrient-deficient mesic savanna. The addition of phosphorus and competition between the grass and legume may assist in maintaining balance between the two plant groups.Aims Improved P supply in nutrient-poor soils favours growth of legumes over grasses. This study aimed to assess how nutrient deficiency, P fertilisation, and competition with a dominant grass species, particularly Themeda triandra, affects the aboveground and belowground growth, N nutrition, and nodulation potential of Vachellia nilotica in the Ukulinga Grassland nutrient experiment.Methods Soils used in the study were collected from superphosphate-fertilised trials (+P, i.e. P-enriched) and non-superphosphate trials (−P, i.e. no P enrichment). V. nilotica seedlings were grown independently and in competition with T. triandra seedlings.Key results Our findings confirmed that soil in +P treatment had greater P and calcium concentrations than did the −P soils. Competition from T. triandra decreased the P concentration, specific nitrogen assimilation rates and the %NDFA in V. nilotica, but the opposite effect was observed for specific nitrogen utilisation rates.Conclusions Zero nodule formation in soils with low P concentrations and competition affected the N source reliance of V. nilotica.Implications The addition of P might maximise N inputs through increased legume growth performance and weaken the competitive effect of a grass species.;2025/05/01;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24079;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24079
Barriers and enablers to referral of older adults to hearing care: a cross-sectional questionnaire study of Australian general practitioners;['Ella C. Davine', 'Peter A. Busby', 'Sanne Peters', 'Jill J. Francis', 'David Harris', 'Barbra H. B. Timmer', 'Julia Z. Sarant'];Background Acquired hearing loss has significant negative effects on quality of life, general health, maintenance of independence, and healthy aging. Despite this, rates of self-directed help seeking are low, as are referral rates from general practice to hearing care. This study aimed to explore the barriers and enablers to general practitioner (GP) referral of adults aged 50+ years to hearing care.Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire was designed using the Theoretical Domains Framework of behaviour change and administered to a self-selected sample of 103 Australian GPs.Results Identified enablers included positive beliefs about the consequences of hearing rehabilitation and experiencing positive role models of hearing care including referral. Contextual issues such as time constraints, costs of hearing care, and limited availability of local audiology resources were the most frequently cited barriers to referral. Content analysis of free-format responses yielded 25 themes in total, eight of which were not previously documented in the published literature.Conclusions GP beliefs about hearing care and the outcomes of referral were generally positive, however, logistical concerns and contextual constraints such as restricted appointment times were prominent barriers to hearing care referral. Identifying the key barriers and enablers to GP referral of older adults to hearing care will facilitate the design of targeted behavioural interventions aimed at increasing referral rates. Further qualitative investigation of the key modifiable barriers and enablers identified in this study is warranted to clarify how best to address these in clinical practice.;2025/06/03;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24224;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24224
Novel fluorinated thiazolidin-4-one derivatives: synthesis and anti-cancer potential against HepG2 and HCT116 cell lines;['Shreyash D. Kadam', 'Denni Mammen', 'Vishwanath Zunjar', 'Rahul R. Bagul'];A novel synthetic route has been designed to introduce fluorine functionality into a series of compounds containing thiazolidin-4-one rings. These compounds were synthesised from various aniline derivatives using a two-step approach: an addition reaction of ethyl isothiocyanate with different aromatic fluorinated anilines, followed by cyclisation to yield the final products. A total of 15 novel fluorinated thiazolidinone compounds were synthesised and characterised using 1H NMR, 19F NMR, Fourier transform–infrared, elemental analysis and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Stereochemistry around the imine bond in the synthesised derivatives was determined using nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. The in vitro anticancer potential of the compounds was tested against two human cancer cell lines, liver (HepG2) and colon (HCT116). The study revealed that the derivatives having fluorine functionality at both the m-positions in the aromatic ring showed promising anticancer potential, as compared to those at o- and p-positions.;2024/08/19;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH23123;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH23123
Sabah’s hidden giant: Nepenthes pongoides (Nepenthaceae), a micro-endemic tropical pitcher plant from northern Borneo;['Alviana Damit', 'Nur Adillah Mohd Yusof', 'Jemson Jumian', 'Charles Clarke', 'Alastair S. Robinson'];Context A poorly characterised carnivorous tropical pitcher plant (Nepenthes) was identified from old reports of a rarely visited low-elevation ultramafic peak in central Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Potentially apomorphic characters in the limited photographic evidence available led the authors to hypothesise that the taxon represented an undescribed species.Aims To locate and document the unknown taxon in situ and, if appropriate, gather sufficient data and voucher material to enable its formal description and associated conservation status assessment.Methods An expedition was made to the type locality to make field observations of the taxon, record habitat, population and ecological data such as infauna, prey spectra and numbers of individuals, and to collect representative vouchers, minimising negative impacts on the small population by taking material in the form of terminal cuttings to allow for the in situ regeneration of sampled individuals from axillary nodes.Key results Nepenthes pongoides is described and illustrated as new to science. The species is characterised by its large size, peltate tendril exsertion, absence of upper pitchers and extremely well-developed, persistent indumentum of long, coarse, dark reddish trichomes, the extent of which is unsurpassed in any other known Bornean Nepenthes species.Conclusions One of the largest species of Nepenthes described in recent years, N. pongoides is endemic to the relatively low-elevation ultramafic Meliau Range of central Sabah. Only 39 mature individuals have been observed across two subpopulations, therefore the species is here assessed as CR (Critically Endangered) under the IUCN Red List criteria owing to its extremely small population size, limited area of occurrence and very high threat of unsustainable poaching for the horticultural trade. As is the case for many microendemic species, the taxon is extremely vulnerable to stochastic events such as fire which, on sufficient scale, could represent extinction level events.Implications The documentation of such remarkable new species in comparatively well-explored rainforest regions such as those of northern Borneo highlights the importance of targeted exploration in remaining wilderness areas to uncover hidden biodiversity. Doing so closes gaps in scientific knowledge, and specifically increases the critical taxonomic and ecological knowledge necessary to support the development and implementation of conservation measures required to reduce the risk of species extinction and concomitant loss of biodiversity.;2024/12/12;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24050;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24050
The HARMONY trial: assessing general practitioner knowledge, attitudes and confidence following culturally safe domestic violence and abuse training;['Molly Allen-Leap', 'Angela Taft', 'Felicity Young', 'Leesa Hooker', 'Kelsey Hegarty'];Background Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) impacts all communities, including migrant/refugee populations. Although general practitioners (GPs) are often a first point of contact for victim-survivors, most lack training in culturally safe responses to DVA.Methods We evaluated culturally safe DVA training (HARMONY), co-delivered by a GP educator and bilingual South Asian DVA advocate, to general practice clinics in Victoria, Australia. The program included clinical audits, case studies, simulated migrant/refugee patients and lived experience videos. Pre- and post-training surveys assessed practitioners’ attitudes, understanding and confidence in responding to DVA.Results Twenty-three of 43 practitioners (53.5%) completed both surveys. Pre-training, 10 practitioners (43.5%) felt confident asking about violence when they thought it might be culturally accepted, and eight (34.8%) were confident locating support resources. Post-training, most practitioners (82.6%) reported increased confidence and communication skills. The training met learning needs for 19 of 23 (82.6%) participants, with 17 of 23 (73.9%) participants reporting greater understanding of cultural safety and South Asian patients’ needs. Practitioners particularly valued the advocate educator’s involvement, with 17 of 23 (73.9%) finding this ‘quite useful’ (n=4) or ‘very useful’ (n=13).Conclusion Although DVA training often improves knowledge and confidence, and may not change clinical behaviour or patient outcomes, embedding cultural safety in such training remains important in responding effectively to the specific needs of ethnically diverse patients and their families experiencing DVA. The HARMONY program demonstrates potential benefits of combining clinical expertise with cultural advocacy, although further research is needed to evaluate its impact on practice and patient care among other minoritised patient communities.;2025/05/27;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24210;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24210
closo-Borate aryliodonium zwitterions: convenient intermediates for functional closo-borane derivatives and molecular materials;['Piotr Kaszyński'];Zwitterionic aryliodonium derivatives of closo-borates are attractive intermediates in regioselective functionalization of anionic boron clusters through nucleophilic substitution with halides, and N-, O- and C-centered reagents. They are easily available in high yields by highly regioselective direct aryliodination of the closo-borate anions with ArIII species, typically PhI(OAc)2 and undergo four types of transformations: substitution through a rearrangement of a 10-I-3 species, dissociation to boronium ylides and trapping with the solvent, single electron transfer and homolysis of the 9-I-2 species to B–I products, and iodoaryl slippage to cage arylation byproducts. These zwitterions exhibit moderate and well-balanced thermal stability, which, in most cases, is sufficient for their isolation and synthetic applications. It depends on the closo-borane, position of the aryliodonium substituent, the presence of other substituents and finally the nature of the aryl group. The two-step process, aryliodination and substitution, can be regarded as a regioselective activation of the B–H bond for nucleophilic substitution. This review summarizes the formation, structure, stability and reactions of zwitterionic derivatives of 10- and 12-vertex closo-borate anions accumulated in the literature in the past decade.;2025/06/04;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH25006;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH25006
The mechanical properties of bettong and potoroo foods;['D. Rex Mitchell', 'Justin A. Ledogar', 'Damien Andrew', 'Ian Mathewson', 'Vera Weisbecker', 'Karl Vernes'];Potoroid marsupials (bettongs and potoroos of the family Potoroidae) are considered ecosystem engineers because of the roles they play in maintaining biodiversity. However, severe declines since European arrival have necessitated intense conservation efforts. Vital to these efforts is an understanding of the physical challenges that define their niches. The mechanical properties of their foods, such as toughness and stiffness, represent a physical interface with the environment that can contribute to quantitatively defining their niches. Here, we provide mechanical property data from wild bettong and potoroo foods, such as roots and tubers, fruit, fungi, invertebrates, seeds, and leaves. Toughness ranged from approximately 56.58J/m2 (fungal sporocarp of Descolea sp.) to 2568.15J/m2 (tubers of the blue yam, Brunoniella australis). Similarly, stiffness of the wild foods ranged from 1.15MPa for Descolea sp. to 30.4MPa for B. australis. However, the mechanical demands of accessing the kernels from within the shells (testae) of sandalwood and quandong (Santalum spp.) seeds far exceed measurements of any foods tested. We also tested some farmed foods, alongside inclusion of data from previous studies. Taken together, these data can also improve selection of comparable foods in designing diets for potoroids, and other species, in captivity.;2024/06/20;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24006;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24006
Half a century of change in floristics and structure in an urban grassy woodland: implications for conservation management;['Jamie B. Kirkpatrick', 'Ian Jenkinson', 'Kerry L. Bridle'];Context Vegetation remnants enveloped by built up areas tend to drift away in their character from vegetation on similar sites in more extensive patches of native vegetation, but may stabilise in synthetic (novel) form with time in harmony with disturbance regimes and environmental change. Managers may be able to induce a synthetic state that maintains the nature conservation values of such remnants.Aims We examine the degree to which the nature conservation values of the the vegetation of a 19th century urban reserve in nipaluna (Hobart), lutruwita (Tasmania) changed between 1974 and 2022/23 in a period of climate change and changes in vegetation management, with the aim of discerning appropriate conservation management regimes.Methods Sixty-nine 1×15m quadrats were randomly located in the non-cultivated part of the Domain in 1974 and roughly relocated for sampling in 1984, 1994, 2001 and 2022. Tree diameters were recorded using the point-centred quarter method in 1974, 1984, 1994, 2001 and 2023. The responses of native and exotic species richness, and the frequency of the more common species, to time and other predictor variables related to time since last fire, evidence of mowing at the time of the survey, and topography were determined using linear modelling, correlation, analysis of variance and chi-squared.Key results The native tree Allocasuarina verticillata was the only significantly varying consistent increaser of 67 taxa. The native perennial herbs Acaena echinata and Leptorhynchos squamatus and the non-native shrubby weed Chrysanthemoides monilifera were the only significantly varying consistent decreasers. However, several rare and threatened species too infrequent for statistical analysis also declined between 2022/23 and 2000. Twenty-four of the 67 taxa with sufficient data for analysis did not significantly vary among years. The percentage of native species in quadrats did not change through time. It was negatively related to mowing and the time since fire. Native tree stems 10–30cm in diameter and those over 30cm increased through time, whereas those less than 10cm in diameter increased dramatically until 2000, then strongly decreased by 2023. Total stem density increased through time.Conclusions Mowing and fire regimes strongly influenced the distributions of a large proportion of native taxa independent of time and underlying environment, largely by controlling the density of the small tree layer, which can potentially form closed-forest without eucalypts.Implications It is possible to use fire, mowing and slashing to maintain nature conservation values in synthetic urban grassy woodland, although the maintenance of the rarest native species requires more specific and varied interventions.;2025/01/09;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24042;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24042
Leading the way: the contribution of Aboriginal community controlled health organisations to community health in Australia;['Tamara Mackean', 'Toby Freeman', 'Connie Musolino', 'Denise Fry', 'Colin MacDougall', 'Virginia Lewis', 'Fran Baum'];Background The Aboriginal community controlled health sector has been a leader in community health in Australia. We sought to understand the influence this sector has had on the non-Indigenous community health movement in Australia since the 1970s.Methods We interviewed 87 key informants on the history of community health in Australia, including policy makers, researchers, medical doctors, allied health, social workers, nurses and politicians. Five were Aboriginal, and 11 had particular experience in Aboriginal community health. A team approach was taken to qualitative analysis using a codebook. We interrogated data to seek evidence for the influence of Aboriginal community health on non-Indigenous community health, and the relationship between the two sectors. This was complemented by construction of a policy timeline.Results Aboriginal community health services were regarded as best practice community health, and informed and influenced practice in non-Indigenous community health services. Non-Indigenous community health was sometimes more of a competitor than an ally. The respect for the Aboriginal community health sector, particularly community controlled, was seen to have grown over time, acknowledging the strengths of the model. Although establishing Aboriginal community health services was a struggle, the resulting model has better resisted managerialist control compared with non-Indigenous community health.Conclusions The Aboriginal health sector developed a vision and practice of community health that went on to inform generalist non-Indigenous community health sector in Australia. The sector continues to remain strong today as an example model of community health that is relevant to all Australians.;2025/04/14;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24223;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24223
‘There must be something in the soil our little plants need’: exploring patterns of potential mycorrhizal associations in the flora of the Sunshine Coast heathlands, Queensland, Australia;['Hilary Pearl', 'Alison Shapcott'];The first general overview of mycorrhizal functional groups associated with the flora of the Queensland Sunshine Coast heathlands, a community of low phylogenetic diversity, is provided in this Short Communication. Broad proportions of plant species associated with mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal functional groups in the heathlands were compared with those in the surrounding rainforest flora, and across the heath strata. This overview suggests that a greater diversity of mycorrhizal strategies and an increased number of plant genera with non-mycorrhizal associations are found in the heathlands, with proportions varying among the strata. These associations may be facilitating the coexistence of plant species and increasing phylogenetic dispersion.;2024/09/17;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT23057;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT23057
Perceptions and willingness concerning the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data in Australian healthcare services;['Daniel Demant', 'Paul Byron', 'Deborah Debono', 'Suneel Jethani', 'Beth Goldblatt', 'Michael Thomson', 'Jo (River) River'];Background Despite growing recognition of the importance of collecting sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data to improve healthcare access and equity for LGBTQA+ populations, uncertainty remains around how these data are collected, their perceived importance and individuals’ willingness to disclose such information in healthcare settings. The aim of this study was to understand perceptions of the collection of data on sexual orientation and gender identity in healthcare settings across Australia, and individuals’ willingness to provide this data.Methods A cross-sectional online survey of 657 Australian residents was conducted to assess participants’ attitudes towards SOGI data in healthcare settings, along with preferences for methods to collect these data. Statistical analyses included ANCOVA, Chi-squared tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.Results Participants generally recognised the importance of the collection of basic demographic data to support the provision of health services. Willingness to share SOGI data varied, with significant differences noted across gender, sexual orientation and cultural backgrounds. LGBTQA+ participants expressed greater willingness to provide SOGI data, but only in contextually appropriate situations, and preferred more inclusive data collection methods.Conclusions The study shows a context-dependent willingness to provide SOGI data in health care, underscoring the need for sensitive data collection methods. Insights into SOGI data collection attitudes are vital for developing inclusive and respectful healthcare practices. Improved SOGI data collection can enrich healthcare outcomes for diverse groups, informing public health policies and practices tailored to LGBTQA+ needs.;2025/03/13;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24178;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24178

Synthesis and stability studies of constrained peptide–antimony bicycles;['Sven Ullrich', 'Pritha Ghosh', 'Minghao Shang', 'Sauhta Siryer', 'Santhanalaxmi Kumaresan', 'Bishvanwesha Panda', 'Lani J. Davies', 'Upamali Somathilake', 'Abhishek P. Patel', 'Christoph Nitsche'];Peptide therapeutics play an increasingly important role in modern drug discovery. Improving the pharmacokinetic profile of bioactive peptides has been effectively achieved with chemical modifications, especially macrocyclisation reactions. Consequently, there is a great demand for highly constrained compounds such as bicyclic peptides. In our previous research, we introduced peptide–bismuth bicycles and peptide–arsenic bicycles as new classes of constrained peptides. In this work, we extend our peptide bicyclisation strategy towards antimony. Similar to arsenic and bismuth, antimony(III) selectively binds to three cysteine residues in peptides, enabling the in situ formation of stable bicycles. The bicyclisation reaction occurs instantaneously under biocompatible conditions at physiological pH. Antimony–peptide bicycles remain largely intact in the presence of the common metal chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and the main endogenous thiol competitor glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, when challenged with bismuth(III) from water-soluble gastrodenol (bismuth tripotassium dicitrate), antimony–peptide bicycles convert into the corresponding bismuth–peptide bicycle, highlighting the superior thiophilicity of bismuth over other pnictogens. Our study further expands the toolbox of peptide multicyclisation with main group elements previously underexplored in chemical biology.;2024/08/27;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24094;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24094
Culturally safe physiotherapy care: how this looks and feels for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples;['Curtley Nelson', 'Roma Forbes', 'Allison Mandrusiak'];"Background Understanding the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as healthcare recipients is essential for delivering culturally safe physiotherapy care; however, the literature inadequately explores these experiences. This study aimed to explore the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who have engaged with physiotherapists and understand their perspectives on how physiotherapists can provide culturally safe care in the community.Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with adult (aged >18years) self-identified Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (n=12) who had received physiotherapy care within a community setting within the previous 3months. A First Nations methodology approach alongside reflexive thematic analysis was used to interpret the data.Results Four themes were generated: (1) building trust through yarning; (2) acknowledging and respecting culture; (3) creating a culturally safe environment; and (4) the importance of professional training.Conclusions Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have expressed that physiotherapists can establish trust with their patients by dedicating time to develop a therapeutic relationship and by demonstrating respect for their culture. It is essential for physiotherapists to carefully consider the physical environment in which they deliver care to ensure it is welcoming and culturally safe for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Physiotherapists should undertake professional development to immerse themselves in First Nations culture and history through connecting with community.

Platypus fyke-netting methods: a review of recommended field protocols and options for assessing population abundance;['Melody Serena', 'Geoff A. Williams', 'Chris Bloink', 'Dana Dekkers'];Fyke nets are the preferred type of equipment used for platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) live-trapping surveys in shallow watercourses. However, numerous factors other than abundance may affect the frequency of platypus captures, including when, where and how nets are set, stream discharge and entry into nets by rakali (Hydromys chrysogaster), which create exit holes that are then also available to a platypus. A threefold difference in the mean monthly frequency of platypus captures in fyke nets is also evident across the year. To limit net evasion, it makes sense to reduce net visibility and minimise opportunities for animals to squeeze under, climb over or walk around nets. Time-lapse cameras can also be deployed at fyke-netting sites to estimate how many individuals evade capture. To protect platypus welfare and the welfare of non-target species held in fyke nets, it is important to ensure that captured animals have access to air, to check nets frequently throughout the time they are set and to release bycatch when first encountered. Fyke-netting studies typically generate sparse platypus population data, so care is needed when selecting and interpreting platypus abundance metrics generated through mark–recapture modelling or use of indices.;2024/11/18;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24026;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24026
Pollination by multiple species of nectar foraging Hymenoptera in Prasophyllum innubum, a critically endangered orchid of the Australian Alps;['Tobias Hayashi', 'Bronwyn M. Ayre', 'Björn Bohman', 'Graham R. Brown', 'Noushka Reiter', 'Ryan D. Phillips'];Context Australia has numerous threatened species of terrestrial orchid, with a particularly high incidence of rarity in the genus Prasophyllum R.Br. Although there has been research on mycorrhizal associations and propagation, little is known about the reproductive ecology of threatened Prasophyllum. Understanding which animals are responsible for pollination and the impact of herbivores on reproduction may inform conservation actions.Aims For the nationally Critically Endangered Prasophyllum innubum, we aimed to determine the pollinator species, test for self-pollination, quantify levels of reproductive success and herbivory, and identify herbivores.Methods Pollinator observations were undertaken at wild populations of P. innubum, whereas an experiment testing for self-pollination was undertaken in shadehouse conditions. We quantified reproductive success and herbivory at two populations and attempted to identify herbivores using game cameras.Key results Pollination occurred via three species of bee and a sphecid wasp, all of which attempted feeding on floral nectar. Fruit set averaged 72–84% at wild sites, whereas only 6% of flowers set fruit via self-pollination when insects were excluded. Just 4% of inflorescences were completely consumed by herbivores, and no herbivory was captured on camera.Conclusions P. innubum has a generalist rewarding pollination system that confers high levels of reproductive success, with herbivory having little impact on reproduction.Implications Pollinator availability is unlikely to restrict conservation translocation site selection of P. innubum because of a generalist pollination system. If herbivores are a threat for this species, it is likely to be through alteration of habitat rather than direct grazing.;2024/07/08;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT23110;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT23110
A new method for the preparation of FeIV and comparison with the performance of FeO42−;['Haoda Guo', 'Linhao Fan', 'Naidong Zhang'];FeO32− acted as a highly effective water-purifying agent and exhibited superior performance compared with FeO42−. The traditional synthesis method of FeO32− requires challenging reaction conditions. This study focused on the environmentally friendly synthesis of green Na2FeO3 crystals using sodium hypochlorite as a medium by a concentration method under depressurisation. In an alkaline hypochlorite system, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed that, under different OH− concentrations and temperatures, hypochlorite can oxidise FeIII to FeO32−. Na2FeO3 served as a highly effective water-purifying agent and was superior to K2FeO4 in the treatment of oil-recovery wastewater. Na2FeO3 and K2FeO4 reacted similarly to organic compounds as determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Additionally, it is less expensive to synthesise Na2FeO3 compared with K2FeO4.;2025/01/31;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24156;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24156
Plant life-history data as evidence of an historical mixed-severity fire regime in Banksia Woodlands;['Russell G. Miller', 'Neal J. Enright', 'Joseph B. Fontaine', 'David J. Merritt', 'Ben P. Miller'];Context The concept of the fire regime is central to understanding and managing fire-prone ecosystems globally, and information on past regimes can provide useful insights into species disturbance adaptations. Although observations from satellite imagery or palaeoecological proxy data can provide direct evidence of past, pre-colonial fire regimes, they may be limited in temporal or spatial resolution and are not available for all ecosystems. However, fire-related plant-trait and demographic data offer an alternative approach to understand species–fire regime associations at the ecosystem scale.Aims We aimed to quantify the life-history strategies and associated fire regimes for six co-occurring shrub and tree species from fire-prone, Mediterranean-climate Banksia Woodlands in south-western Australia.Methods We collected static demographic data on size structure, seedling recruitment, and plant mortality across sites of varying time since last fire. We combined demographic data with key fire-related species traits to define plant life-history strategies. We then compared observed life histories with a priori expectations for surface, stand-replacing, and mixed-severity fire-regime types to infer historical fire-regime associations.Key results Fire-killed shrubs and weakly serotinous trees had abundant post-fire seedling recruitment, but also developed multi-cohort populations during fire-free periods via inter-fire seedling recruitment. Resprouting shrubs had little seedling recruitment at any time, even following fire, and showed no signs of decline in the long absence of fire, likely owing to their very long lifespans.Conclusions The variation in life-history strategies for these six co-occurring species is consistent with known ecological strategies to cope with high variation in fire intervals in a mixed-severity fire regime. Whereas resprouting and strong post-fire seedling recruitment indicate a tolerance of shorter fire intervals, inter-fire recruitment and weak serotiny are interpreted as a bet-hedging strategy to cope with occasional long fire-free periods that may otherwise exceed adult and seed-bank lifespans.Implications Our findings suggested that Banksia Woodlands have evolved with highly variable fire intervals in a mixed-severity fire regime. Further investigations of species adaptations to varying fire size and patchiness can help extend our understanding of fire-regime tolerances.;2024/07/11;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT23098;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT23098
Mental health consumers and primary care providers co-designing improvements and innovations: a scoping review;['Kathryn Thorburn', 'Bani Aadam', 'Shifra Waks', 'Brett Bellingham', 'Mark F. Harris', 'Karen R. Fisher', 'Catherine Spooner'];Co-design and co-production are increasingly used to improve and innovate healthcare practices and services to better address people’s healthcare needs. Mental health consumers, especially people diagnosed with serious mental illness, experience considerable health disparities and barriers to primary care, while primary care providers experience barriers to addressing the healthcare needs of people diagnosed with serious mental illness. Both mental health consumers and primary care providers bring knowledge and expertise to improving mental health consumers’ health care. This scoping review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was undertaken to determine the extent and scope of co-design and co-production involving mental health consumers and primary care providers to address mental health consumers’ healthcare needs. The review also sought to determine factors that enable or limit co-design and co-production involving mental health consumers and primary care providers. Twelve studies and reports of co-design and co-production involving mental health consumers and primary care providers were identified by the review. These studies showed that co-design and co-production were feasible and beneficial, and that there was significant scope for collaboration at the intersection of mental health and primary care services. Lessons learned from projects that have led the way include the need for (1) co-design/co-production practices that sustain equitable participation and address inevitable power imbalances when service users and service providers work together, (2) sufficient reporting on methods to ascertain claims of co-design/co-production and allow replication of these methods in similar healthcare improvement projects, and (3) co-design/co-production projects to be supported by other systems change strategies.;2025/03/06;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24104;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24104
How soil fungal communities respond to invasive plant species treatments in soil from Banksia woodland, south-western Australia;['Aaron J. Brace', 'Katinka X. Ruthrof', 'Joseph B. Fontaine', 'Ben P. Miller', 'Anna J. M. Hopkins'];Context Invasive plants are one of the most significant threats to woodlands globally. Methods of invasive plant control include manual removal and herbicide application. While the impacts of control methods on invasive and off-target native plant species are often explored, the impacts on below-ground organisms, such as fungi, are less well understood.Aims We conducted a glasshouse trial to investigate the responses of soil fungal communities to herbicides and manual removal that are used to control common invasive plant species in Banksia woodland in south-western Australia.Methods Broad spectrum (glyphosate and pelargonic acid) and grass-specific (fluazifop-p-butyl) herbicides were separately applied to pots containing either Ehrharta calycina, a key invasive grass species or Eucalyptus todtiana, a native woodland tree at the recommended woodland rate. After sixweeks, samples of treated soils were subjected to high throughput sequencing to determine fungal community diversity, richness, relative abundance, composition and putative ecosystem function.Key results Pelargonic acid induced the widest range of changes including decreased fungal richness and Shannon diversity but all herbicides affected community composition. Within functional groups, fluazifop-p-butyl led to a significant decrease of symbiotrophs in the mycorrhizal species.Conclusions We show that invasive species management, in the manner applied, can lead to immediate changes in fungal community composition.Implications Observed patterns require further exploration, particularly repeat testing under different environmental conditions, to better determine the impact and mode of action of herbicides on below-ground organisms. The functional changes in the soil fungal community could further disturb the soil fungal community and complicate subsequent management considerations.;2025/05/13;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24083;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24083
AuNPs synthesised in situ from self-assembled peptide hydrogels modulating peptide secondary structure;['Bin Huang', 'Lingyi Li', 'Fuzhen Yan', 'Fangjie Liu', 'Jin Zhang', 'Linlin Zhong', 'Wenlong Xu'];The disease caused by amyloidosis is thought to be due to the toxicity of the hydrophobic groups exposed by the β-sheet structure among amyloid oligomers. The non-specific binding of nanomaterials to proteins and peptides may be able to modulate the β-sheet structure. In this work, we designed an amphipathic peptide Fmoc-FFCKK-OH based on the amyloid peptide FF sequence in order to evaluate nanomaterials as amyloid aggregation regulators. Au3+ was used to modulate peptide self-assembly to form hydrogels and to form gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in situ under the reduction of –SH. We simplified the complex process of structural transformation of proteins and peptides by constructing a hydrogel model. The transformation and aggregation behaviour of the secondary structure of peptides on the surface of AuNPs over time was investigated. Circular dichroism (CD) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) were used to observe the transition from random coil to β-sheet with some α-helix within Fmoc-FFCKK-OH. This work not only simplifies the complexity of the study but also contributes to the understanding of the role of AuNPs in the regulation of amyloid formation and provides a research basis for AuNPs as amyloid regulators.;2025/02/04;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24086;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24086
GPS tracking informs nest reserve design for an endangered raptor, the grey goshawk (Tachyspiza novaehollandiae), in hostile anthropogenic landscapes;['David A. Young', 'James B. Kirkpatrick'];We used GPS telemetry to investigate space use and movements of 15 grey goshawks (Tachyspiza novaehollandiae) in south-east Tasmania, Australia, between 2021 and 2023. The number of nests per territory in 73 active breeding territories was also determined and inter-nest distances were calculated. Mean minimum convex polygon (MCP) non-breeding season home range size of female goshawks was more than twice as large as the mean breeding season home range size. Home range size of males was similar in the breeding and non-breeding seasons and the MCP estimates suggest their home ranges are much larger than that of females. Tracked goshawks were range residents throughout the year with kernel density (KD) core areas centred on nest trees and preferred foraging locations. Movement patterns were highly recursive although some individuals occasionally undertook long range excursions away from their nests. Mean number of nests per goshawk breeding territory was 2.0 (range 1–6). Median distance between nests in breeding territories was 78.0m (range 1.8–915.0m). We recommend that prescriptive nest reserves for grey goshawks be implemented based on our 50%, 75% and 95% KD core area estimates for females in the breeding season. We provide a conceptualised example of a nest reserve design.;2025/03/14;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24025;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24025
Detection of rabbit and wombat warrens in broad-scale satellite imagery;['Natarsha McPherson', 'Bertram Ostendorf'];The ability to accurately assess the spatial pattern of wild animal distributions is essential for conservation management. Warrens constructed by burrowing species offer proxies for estimating geographic occupation. We tested the feasibility of open-access satellite-based detection for two semi-fossorial mammals, the southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), across the Nullarbor Plain, South Australia. Along two 100km road sections, we collected GPS locations of warrens from ground-walked transects (~1km) at 22 sites. Wombat and rabbit warrens were identified and digitised using Google Earth and Microsoft Bing imagery (<1.5m resolution) for each transect. We found a significant correlation between satellite and field estimates with R2 values of 0.98 (P<1×10−15) and 0.56 (P<1×10−4) for wombat and rabbit warrens, respectively. User accuracy was high for both wombat (91%) and rabbit (81%) warrens. Omission in the satellite imagery was low for wombats (14%) but high for rabbit warrens (44%). However, small warrens less than 10m in diameter accounted for 79% of rabbit warren omissions. This demonstrates that the geospatial pattern of warrens constructed by two semi-fossorial mammals can be detected and distinguished in broad-scale satellite imagery across Australia’s semi-arid landscape.;2025/02/10;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24017;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24017
Origins of the rare Australian daisy Erigeron conyzoides and its implications for biological control research and conservation management;['Stephanie H. Chen', 'Alicia Grealy', 'Michelle A. Rafter', 'Ben Gooden', 'Alexander N. Schmidt-Lebuhn'];Context Confidence in risk analyses for weed biological control (biocontrol) agents is underpinned by knowledge of the phylogenetic associations between the target weed and off-target plant species, with an emphasis on native taxa that co-occur with the weed in its introduced range. The origins of off-target plant species are also considered when assessing potential adverse effects of releasing weed biocontrol agents into the environment. Erigeron bonariensis L. (flaxleaf fleabane), native to South America, is a major cropping weed in North America, Europe, and Australia. Phylogenomic analysis of the weed’s tribe, Astereae, for a biocontrol program has put into question the existence of native Australian fleabanes.Aims We aimed to resolve the establishment means of a supposed native species to Australia by testing its phylogenetic and morphological associations with other Erigeron taxa at a global scale.Methods Target-sequence capture data were combined with traditional taxonomy.Key results We rediscovered the closest presumed native relative of flaxleaf fleabane, the rare and declining E. conyzoides F.Muell. (daisy fleabane), during field work in Victoria, Australia. Molecular data and morphology indicated that E. conyzoides and E. acer L. from the northern hemisphere are not distinct.Conclusions Erigeron conyzoides is very likely not a distinct species endemic to Australia but rather a disjunct population of E. acer.Implications This finding improves confidence in the host-specificity of candidate biocontrol agents for fleabane in Australia, because we argue that the closest related truly native species is much more distantly related to fleabane than previously thought.;2025/01/09;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24047;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24047
Chiral 1-D coordination polymer chains featuring 1,1′-binaphthyl;['Hui Min Tay', 'Shannon Thoonen', 'Carol Hua'];Four 1-D chain coordination polymers containing bent 1,1′-binaphthyl ligands were synthesised with NiII, CuII and AgI. The use of (R)-4,4′-(2,2′-diethoxy-[1,1′-binaphthalene]-6,6′)dipyridine as a ligand yielded isostructural 1-D looping chains with NiII and CuII, whereas the use of AgI yielded both linear and helical 1-D chains. Changing the dipyridyl coordination groups to dicarboxylates in (S)-6,6′-dicarboxyl-2,2′-diethoxy-1,1′-binaphthalene yielded a 1-D looping chain with a CuII paddlewheel motif. The AgI 1-D chain features two crystallographically distinct 1-D chain morphologies with a triple helix and linear strips. The packing arrangement of the 1-D chains differs because of the intermolecular interactions present, with the steric bulk of the ethoxy substituent on the 1,1′-binaphthyl enabling the formation of large void spaces.;2024/06/14;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24031;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24031
closo-Borate aryliodonium zwitterions: convenient intermediates for functional closo-borane derivatives and molecular materials;['Piotr Kaszyński'];Zwitterionic aryliodonium derivatives of closo-borates are attractive intermediates in regioselective functionalization of anionic boron clusters through nucleophilic substitution with halides, and N-, O- and C-centered reagents. They are easily available in high yields by highly regioselective direct aryliodination of the closo-borate anions with ArIII species, typically PhI(OAc)2 and undergo four types of transformations: substitution through a rearrangement of a 10-I-3 species, dissociation to boronium ylides and trapping with the solvent, single electron transfer and homolysis of the 9-I-2 species to B–I products, and iodoaryl slippage to cage arylation byproducts. These zwitterions exhibit moderate and well-balanced thermal stability, which, in most cases, is sufficient for their isolation and synthetic applications. It depends on the closo-borane, position of the aryliodonium substituent, the presence of other substituents and finally the nature of the aryl group. The two-step process, aryliodination and substitution, can be regarded as a regioselective activation of the B–H bond for nucleophilic substitution. This review summarizes the formation, structure, stability and reactions of zwitterionic derivatives of 10- and 12-vertex closo-borate anions accumulated in the literature in the past decade.;2025/06/04;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH25006;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH25006
Thermal drones are highly effective for detecting elusive Bennett’s tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus bennettianus) in Australia’s tropical rainforests;['Emmeline Bernadette Barrett Norris', 'Johan Larson'];Tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus spp.) are poorly studied owing to their elusive arboreal nature, which makes detection difficult using traditional methods such as spotlighting and hand-held thermal cameras. This note documents the first successful detection of Bennett’s tree kangaroos (D. bennettianus) using thermal drones in tropical rainforest at Cape Tribulation, Australia. In less than an hour, six individuals were observed across 17ha. The method proved minimally invasive and highly effective in rainforest environments despite dense vegetation and high temperatures, demonstrating both the unexpected abundance of this species and the utility of thermal drones for monitoring tropical arboreal fauna.;2025/02/04;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24053;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24053
The role of general practice to address the supportive care needs of Australian cancer survivors: a qualitative study;['Olivia Bellas', 'Emma Kemp', 'Jackie Roseleur', 'Laura C. Edney', 'Candice Oster', 'Jonathan Karnon'];"Background Cancer survivors have a broad range of supportive care needs that are not consistently managed in general practice. Understanding the barriers primary healthcare providers face in providing high quality supportive care is crucial for improving the delivery of supportive care in general practice.Methods This Australian qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews with general practitioners (n=9), practice nurses (n=8), and a community liaison worker employed in general practice (n=1), to explore barriers and facilitators to identifying and managing supportive care for cancer survivors. Data were thematically analysed to develop recurring themes related to the identification and provision of supportive care.Results Four major themes were developed: identification of supportive care needs, time and provision of supportive care, challenges in supportive care for diverse populations, and desire for more information. Improved education; enhanced communication across all levels of healthcare, including centralised access to patient information; and greater knowledge of available services were highlighted as facilitators to the management of supportive care for cancer survivors.Conclusions Targeted efforts to support the facilitators identified here can contribute to more effective management of supportive care for diverse cancer survivor populations to improve the overall quality of care and health outcomes for these individuals.";2025/04/14;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24098;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24098
Does tree hollow volume influence use by small arboreal mammals?;['William Terry', 'Ross L. Goldingay'];Identifying the specific tree hollow requirements of hollow dependent fauna is central to managing these shelter resources, as well as determining where habitat restoration is required. We installed pairs of carved tree hollows of different cavity volume at 14 sites to investigate whether preferences were shown by the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), inland sugar glider (Petaurus notatus) and agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis). Small (1500cm3) cavities should be of sufficient size to support non-breeding individuals, whereas large (9000cm3) cavities should be required for breeding. Camera traps showed that the probability of visitation was highly seasonal but did not differ between hollow types for any species. Despite a high probability of visitation per week by all species (0.45–0.75, in summer), inspection of the hollows showed that few were occupied. Two phascogale nests were observed in large hollows and one in a small hollow. Nesting sugar gliders were seen in two large hollows and a nest was seen in another. No antechinus nests were recorded. Low occupancy of artificial hollows relative to high visitation, and compared with the results of other studies, is attributed to abundant natural hollows within our study area. Management of nest box programs requires careful planning that should include an evaluation of the existing tree hollow resource prior to any intervention.;2025/03/27;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24039;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24039
The assembly of the vegetation near the treeline during the Late Glacial and Holocene in south-central Tasmania;['G. A. Astorga', 'G. J. Jordan', 'A. Martel-Cea'];Context In Tasmania, most glacial pollen records suggest treeless conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), but molecular evidence points to glacial survival of tree species in unexpected refugia. Plant macrofossils can help clarify whether woody species survived in local microrefugia or tracked their climatic preferences across the landscape.Aims This study investigates vegetation changes near the treeline in south-central Tasmania to understand species survival, dispersal, and community assembly during the Late Glacial–Holocene transition.Methods We used the analysis of plant macrofossils from Lake Dobson (1034masl) to reconstruct vegetation changes over the past 15,000years.Key results Our findings show that alpine conifers were present in the subalpine area of Lake Dobson by c. 15thousand calibrated years before present (calkyr BP) and probably assembled from local microrefugia. Although present in the Late Glacial, species such as Nothofagus cunninghamii increased with the onset of warmer climates in the early Holocene. In contrast, subalpine eucalypts appeared later, c. 8calkyr BP. Overall, the results imply that the modern configuration of the vegetation, i.e. Eucalyptus open woodlands, was not reached before ~6calkyr BP.Conclusions This study has highlighted the variability in plant responses and community assembly during the Late Glacial–Holocene transition, a period of significant environmental change that is not yet well understood in the southern hemisphere.Implications Treeline investigations spanning the transition from late-glacial to interglacial conditions allow us to understand how fast plant species responded to past environmental fluctuations and how species may respond to projected climate change.;2025/05/29;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24082;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24082
Synthesis of novel mono BN substituted symmetrical and asymmetrical perylene diimides for fluoride anion detection;['Luna Yang', 'Yifan Wang', 'Chenhao Wang', 'Feng Liu', 'Weiping Chen', 'Yonggang Wu', 'Hongchi Zhao'];Three novel mono BN substituted perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, namely PDI-BN1, PDI-BN2 and PDI-BN3, were designed and efficiently synthesised using a concise synthetic strategy. Their molecular structures were confirmed by NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry and FTIR. The electronic and optical characteristics were also comparatively studied. These BN substituted PDI derivatives exhibited orange fluorescence, with their properties finely adjustable by integrating various fused aryl rings. Except for F− ions, all the BN substituted PDI derivatives have shown no affinity for other anions, such as Cl−, Br−, I−, , AcO−, , , , and . Cytotoxic evaluation on HeLa cells revealed that PDI-BN1 was found to be non-toxic, and cellular imaging studies were carried out to authenticate the real applicability of PDI-BN1 in F− ion detection.;2025/03/14;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24146;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24146
Bayesian approaches to assigning the source of an odour detected by an electronic nose;['D. Brynn Hibbert'];After a brief review of electronic nose technology, the use of an Australian electronic nose to identify an unknown odour out of a set of known odours is described. Multivariate supervised learning is accomplished by applying Bayes’ theorem to data from metal oxide semiconductor sensors responding to each of a number of target odours. An odour from an unknown source is then assigned a probability of membership of each of the training sets by applying either a Naïve Bayes algorithm to the deemed independent data from each sensor, or to a multinormal distribution of the data. A flat prior (equal probabilities of each outcome) is usually adopted, but for particular situations where one odour is known to predominate, then suitably weighted priors can be used. A source ‘none of the above’, which has a small likelihood covering the space of the possible sensor responses, is included for completeness. This also avoids the assignment to a source that has an extremely small probability but which is greater than that of any other source. Examples are given of a single source (detecting diabetes from a patient’s breath), and three sources of unpleasant odours in a meat processing plant.;2024/09/18;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24053;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24053
A review of the ecology and conservation of the yellow-bellied glider;['Ross L. Goldingay'];The conservation of Australia’s wildlife requires detailed knowledge of the ecology of individual species. That knowledge needs to be synthesised from time to time so that a consistent understanding arises and that knowledge gaps are identified. The yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis) is a forest-dependent species of eastern and southern mainland Australia that has been a focal species for research because it occurs in forest subject to logging. In 2022, it became listed by the Australian government as a threatened species throughout its geographic range, highlighting the need for a detailed review of its ecology and conservation requirements. I reviewed 161 articles, which showed that the most frequently covered topics were on its diet and foraging behaviour, habitat and surveys and distribution. A prominent item in its diet is eucalypt sap, which it obtains from a small number of trees in the forest (≤4% of available trees), and which are incised repeatedly, although periodically, over many years. Yellow-bellied gliders make frequent loud calls at night to advertise territories defended by family groups of two to six individuals. This calling behaviour forms the basis of population monitoring, including recently by using audio-recorders. A paradoxical aspect of yellow-bellied glider ecology is that it is dependent on tree hollows for shelter, but its occurrence is generally not influenced by the abundance of hollow-bearing trees, probably owing to groups occupying large areas of forest (30–80ha). More important drivers of its occurrence appear to be the availability of certain tree species favoured in sap feeding, a diversity of tree species (including winter-flowering) that provide an array of plant and insect exudates, and substrates for arthropods included in its diet. Threats to the yellow-bellied glider include habitat fragmentation and the recent wildfires that have caused a decline in many populations. Climate change is predicted to lead to widespread contraction in the geographic range. These threats highlight the need to identify multiple climate and wildfire refuges throughout its geographic range to ensure its long-term conservation. Long-term monitoring of these and other locations is needed to guide this conservation.;2025/02/21;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24041;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24041
Healthcare workers’ perspectives on the implementation of tuberculosis infection prevention and control policy in rural Papua New Guinea;['Gigil Marme', 'Jerzy Kuzma', 'Peta-Anne Zimmerman', 'Shannon Rutherford', 'Neil Harris'];Background Tuberculosis (TB) infection prevention and control (TB-IPC) is recommended as an essential public health intervention to control TB transmission worldwide. Nonetheless, merely applying evidence-based prevention and control measures is often inadequate for effective TB prevention and treatment goals. This study examined healthcare workers’ (HCWs’) perceptions of strategies important for TB-IPC in primary healthcare (PHC) settings in Papua New Guinea.Methods Using a nominal group technique, this study sought the views of a diverse range of HCWs (ranging from clinical, IPC personnel to policymakers) from national and subnational levels, and various provinces to prioritise TB-IPC guidelines implementation needs in practice. Group discussions were conducted with 51 HCWs, and encompassed quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques. Nine key strategies drawn from a preceding study and literature review were presented to participating HCWs, and from these, three significant strategies related to TB-IPC policy were identified as key priorities.Results The participants recommended HCWs’ capacity building on TB-IPC policy and strategy, improving PHC infrastructure, and increasing community awareness of TB as the most important strategies to improve TB-IPC practices.Conclusions This study investigated the perceptions of diverse key HCWs of the implementation of TB-IPC guidelines in PHC settings in rural Papua New Guinea. The HCWs identified key strategies needed for effective TB-IPC practice in PHC to prevent TB transmission. This study supports previous recommendations that call for adopting multi-pronged strategies to improve the high TB burden. Key stakeholders’ insights have been shared to inform public health policy and program implementation both locally and as part of the global goals of the TB eradication program.;2025/05/19;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24051;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24051
Structural diversity in nudibranch chemistry: elucidation of norditerpenes with a dendrillane scaffold from the Australian nudibranch Goniobranchus coi;['Louise C. Forster', 'Gregory K. Pierens', 'James J. De Voss', 'Mary J. Garson'];In addition to three known compounds (1–3), two new rearranged spongian diterpenes (4 and 5) with perhydroazulene and dioxabicyclooctane ring systems were isolated from the mantle and viscera of the Australian nudibranch Goniobranchus coi. The relative configuration of the major spiroepoxide 4 was explored by comparison with those of m-chloroperbenzoic acid oxidation products derived from dendrillolide A (1). Aldehydes 6 and 7 were identified as the ring-opened artefacts of the spiroepoxides 5 and 4 respectively, and yielded ketone 3 on storage. The relative configurations of lactols 8 and 9, isolated as an inseparable mixture of diastereomers, were deduced by molecular modelling and computational studies. Acetylation of the lactol mixture provided dendrillolide A (1), further confirming the structural assignments of 8 and 9. Dissection of animal tissue established that the norditerpenoid metabolites were present in both mantle and viscera tissues.;2024/07/09;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH24073;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH24073
Factors contributing directly to platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) mortality and implications for conserving populations in the wild;['Melody Serena', 'Geoff A. Williams', 'Jessica L. Thomas'];Based on details of more than 400 platypus deaths with an identifiable cause recorded since 1989, five main factors contributed directly to platypus mortalities: drowning in fish nets or enclosed crustacean traps (such as opera house traps), being killed by predators (especially canids), becoming accidentally hooked by recreational anglers who then cut the line, becoming entangled in discarded fishing line or other types of litter and being hit by motor vehicles (especially, though not exclusively, in Tasmania). Additional mortality factors included drought, severe flooding, being drawn into irrigation pumps and entrapment in manmade materials or infrastructure. Disease was implicated as being the likely causal agent in two platypus deaths, including a female that died late in lactation. Platypus mortalities were recorded throughout the year on the southeastern Australian mainland but peaked in early autumn, when many recently weaned juveniles are likely to be present. Given the very high number of platypus mortalities attributed to the use of fish nets or enclosed crustacean traps, their use should be banned in all waters where platypus population are known to occur.;2025/01/02;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24032;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24032
Implications of varroa mite establishment for Australian plants and their persistence;['Tom Le Breton', 'Amy-Marie Gilpin', 'Chantelle Doyle', 'Mark K.J. Ooi'];The European honeybee (Apis mellifera) is a highly abundant introduced pollinator with widely established feral populations across a large proportion of Australia. Both managed and feral populations contribute significantly to the pollination of many native plant species but have also disrupted native plant-pollinator dynamics. Varroa mite (Varroa destructor), a parasite associated with the collapse of feral or unmanaged European honeybee populations globally, has recently become established in Australia and will inevitably spread across the country. If feral honeybee populations decline significantly, there may be a range of effects on Australian native plant species, including pollination dynamics and seed set. This would have potential implications for the risks faced by native species, particularly those already threatened. However, the exact effects of a decline in feral honeybees on native plants are uncertain as the role of honeybees in Australian ecosystems is poorly understood. We identify potential consequences of the spread of varroa mite and highlight the large knowledge gaps that currently limit our understanding of the subsequent impacts on the Australian flora.;2025/03/11;Australian Journal of Botany;10.1071/BT24020;https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT24020
Determination of population age structure from the survivorship of individuals of unknown ages in unicorns and platypuses;['J. W. Macgregor', 'P. A. Fleming', 'O. Wade', 'R. Donaldson', 'K. S. Warren'];Population age structure is an important parameter for wildlife population modelling. However, for many species it is not possible to accurately assess the age of adult individuals. We present a hypothetical example to illustrate a previously described method of determining population age structure from the survivorship of individuals of unknown ages that to our knowledge is unused in the fields of zoology and ecology. We then apply this method to data collected over 10years for a population of wild platypuses (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), a species whose adult individuals cannot be accurately aged and for which only limited data on life history characteristics are available. Our results show a lower mortality rate over the first years of life of platypuses than the one previous study available for comparison, and suggested a Type I or Type III survivorship curve.;2025/03/28;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24027;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24027
Ionic liquid-assisted synthesis of pyrrole derivative: a green and sustainable method;[' Vaishali', 'Shubham Sharma', 'Preeti Jain', 'Ankush Thakur', 'Sobhi M. Gomha', 'Swati Rani'];Green synthesis is attracting researchers worldwide because of its unique features and environmental benefits. Scientists are inventing novel ionic liquids (ILs) and refining their properties for use in green chemistry and synthesis, such as in green and sustainable solvents and catalysts. Owing to their unique properties, they have been widely used as green catalysts and solvent systems to develop various significant heterocycles. Among aza-heterocycles, pyrrole derivatives are regarded for their versatility in medication development and research. Organic chemists have developed pyrrole-based frameworks employing ILs as solvents and catalysts, achieving major green and sustainable synthesis goals. This study focuses on the literature (2001–24) on pyrrole and its derivatives synthesised by using ILs as solvents and catalysts.;2025/05/12;Australian Journal of Chemistry;10.1071/CH25002;https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/pdf/CH25002
Stopping syphilis on the streets: embedding point of care testing within a street outreach nursing service;['Leanne Papas', 'Kim Rayner', 'Karyn Walsh', 'Elena McLeish', 'Joseph Debattista', 'Diane Rowling'];"Background Nationally, the increase in syphilis notifications over recent years has demonstrated persistent bridging across to wider populations, particularly women of reproductive age. Populations experiencing adverse social determinants, caught in a cycle of marginalisation and social exclusion through mental ill-health, alcohol and drug misuse, and economic and housing stress, have increasingly become susceptible.Methods The aim of this pilot was to develop and implement a protocol for delivering syphilis point of care testing (POCT) through a street-based nursing outreach program, specifically to the homeless, with a focus on women. The evaluation utilised a multi-methods approach to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the service, i.e. qualitative through discussions with nursing staff and clients; and quantitative through the collection and analysis of simple demographic (gender, Indigenous status, housing, age status) and test data.Results The 6-month pilot demonstrated the potential utility of opportunistic syphilis testing and the ease with which the POCT could be incorporated within existing service delivery by outreach nursing teams. Nurses reported the test as easy to apply. The pilot was received well by nurses who gained confidence in the delivery of sexual health education and testing. Nonetheless, despite the establishment of testing, management, and referral protocols, as well as thorough training and preparation, a number of important challenges became apparent through the course of the pilot, particularly with respect to recruitment and follow-up of test results.Conclusions This project effectively embedded a rapid diagnostic assay (Syphilis POCT) within a well-established, outreach health service working within the most marginalised inner-city communities. Nonetheless the challenge with referring syphilis reactive clients for follow-up has necessitated a review of referral protocols and what additional services, including treatment, can be delivered by nurses at the point of first engagement. The need for linking outreach teams with a broad range of other accessible primary health services is considered a priority to ensure efficient referral of homeless persons and minimise loss to follow-up.";2025/05/27;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24188;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24188
Community health in Victoria: a history of challenges, adaptations and potential;['Virginia Lewis', 'Jennifer Macmillan', 'T. McBride', 'David Legge'];Background The Whitlam Labor government established the Community Health Program (CHP) in Australia in 1973 to improve access to health and related welfare services nationally. States reacted differently to the program. Designated Australian Government funding for the program ended in 1981. In spite of fluctuating state government support and changing legislative frameworks over time, Victoria is the only state that continues to operate a generic community health centre (CHC) program reflecting the original CHP.Methods Data were collected from policy documents and archival material, as well as interviews with 29 key stake holders from Victoria. Transcripts from the interviews were reviewed by the interviewees and permission given to include identifiable quotes. The research is part of a larger Australian Research Council project looking at the history of community health in Australia.Results In Victoria the CHP broke new ground in several respects including creating a public primary health care (PHC) sector, promoting equitable access to PHC, introducing salaried GPs, creating multidisciplinary PHC teams, valuing community involvement (in planning, accountability, health promotion) and taking action on the social determinants of health. Key stakeholders described the challenges that the sector has faced in the decades from 1973 to the current day. The basis for the sector’s survival ultimately rests with how it was initially established and the cultural environment in which it developed and continues to operate. In addition to the (albeit irregular) geographically wide distribution of CHCs, their high level of public recognition and sense of community ownership were seen as critical factors that aided their survival and worked against their closure or absorption into hospital networks.Conclusions Based on a synthesis of our findings and personal experiences, we propose five new directions for policy, management and practice that could support this model to have a greater contribution to the health system in Australia.;2025/03/18;Australian Journal of Primary Health;10.1071/PY24194;https://www.publish.csiro.au/py/pdf/PY24194
Asymmetric gait in locomotion of Hypsiprymnodon moschatus, the most primitive extant macropodoid marsupial;['Peter J. Bishop', 'Amy C. Tschirn', 'Aaron B. Camens', 'Gavin J. Prideaux'];"The evolutionary history of kangaroos and their relatives cannot be understood without considering the origins of their diverse locomotor behaviours, especially hopping. As the most primitive extant macropodoid, the musky rat-kangaroo, Hypsiprymnodon moschatus, can offer insight into evolution within the group, including the origin of bipedal hopping locomotion. Adult H. moschatus individuals were filmed in the wild to study their locomotor behaviour. Quantitative analysis of temporal footfall patterns showed that H. moschatus uses exclusively asymmetric gaits across slow and fast speeds of locomotion, predominantly employing a bounding gait. In addition, observations confirmed that it is restricted to quadrupedal gaits even at very fast speeds; there remains no evidence of hopping in this species. These results support the hypothesis that a shift to an asymmetric-gait-dominant locomotor repertoire was a functional prerequisite in the evolution of bipedal hopping in macropodoids.";2025/03/20;Australian Mammalogy;10.1071/AM24050;https://www.publish.csiro.au/am/pdf/AM24050
