Nationally consistent mapping of wildland fuel types across Australia using satellite-derived vegetation structural data;['Rakesh C. Joshi', 'Miguel G. Cruz', 'Randall J. Donohue'];Background Knowledge of the distribution of wildland fuels across the landscape is necessary for the appropriate application of models used to support a broad range of fire management activities.Aims To develop an automated and nationally consistent method that generates up-to-date spatial fuel type information across Australia.Methods Data from various space-borne broad-band optical, LiDAR and radar sensors were combined with land use data to generate structural descriptions of vegetation that were then converted into fuel types.Key results An Australian fuel type spatial layer was generated using the Bushfire Fuel Classification fuel typology. Evaluation against field measurements revealed accuracies of 89 and 71% for native forest and non-forest fuel types, respectively. This product provides a higher level of spatial and structural detail than previously obtained by other national-level fuel classification approaches in Australia.Implications The developed fuel type layer is made available and can be readily used in research applications. The data also have use in supporting jurisdictional-level fuel mapping for a range of fire management applications, such as fire behaviour prediction, fire danger forecasting and risk assessment.;2025/05/01;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24224;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24224
Non-additive effects on plant mixtures flammability in a tropical mountain ecosystem;['Helena Roland', 'Ilaíne Silveira Matos', 'Bruno H. P. Rosado', 'Imma Oliveras Menor'];Background Consumability, a component of flammability, describes how well plants burn and may be influenced by species traits and climate change. However, knowledge gaps remain regarding how species mixtures interact and whether non-additive effects are mediated by functional traits and diversity.Aims This study examined the consumability of species mixtures in Brazil’s tropical montane grasslands (campos de altitude), focusing on traits and species interactions.Methods Laboratory tests measured remaining biomass (a proxy for consumability) in monospecific and three-species mixtures for seven species. Traits like specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), fuel moisture at ignition (FMCig) and maximum combustion rate (MCR) were assessed, along with functional diversity, to understand their influence on consumability.Results Consumability in species mixtures differed from predictions based on individual species values, indicating non-additive effects. Leptostelma maximum, Pleroma hospita and Chusquea pinifolia, despite low or medium individual consumability, contributed most to mixture consumability. Higher SLA reduced consumability, whereas higher MCR, LDMC and functional index FRich increased it.Conclusions Our results suggest that low-consumability species like L. maximum may reduce fire severity, offering opportunities for fire management in the campos de altitude.Implications These findings highlight the importance of considering species interactions in mixtures and identifying traits that shape plant community flammability.;2025/05/01;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24168;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24168
Igniting river health? Testing the effectiveness of low intensity burns to improve riparian vegetation quality in modified ecosystems;['Elisha Duxbury', 'Kirstie Fryirs', 'Michelle R. Leishman'];Background Fire is largely untested for controlling invasive exotic plant species in highly modified riparian systems.Aims This study tested a low intensity burn in combination with herbicide application for reducing cover of three riparian woody weeds and increasing the presence of native plant species.Methods We surveyed native and exotic riparian vegetation and three target woody weeds over 1 year at a river reach that underwent herbicide treatment and a low intensity burn. Fire temperatures were recorded at the soil surface and 10-cm depth.Key results Maximum temperatures in burned areas exceeded 399°C at the soil surface and reached 47.1°C at 10-cm depth. Exotic midstorey species richness and woody riparian weed cover were considerably less 3-months after burning and herbicide treatment compared with herbicide treatment alone, then subsequently increased.Conclusions A combination of herbicide treatment with follow-up low intensity burning may be effective in reducing woody weed cover in the short term. However, fire temperatures recorded during the burn may not be hot enough to trigger fire-promoted native species germination.Implications Using low intensity burns in riparian systems to promote native plant regeneration has promise, however, integrated weed management utilising fire in highly modified riparian systems will require follow-up interventions within a relatively short timeframe.;2025/05/01;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24140;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24140
Pyrogeographic analysis of drivers of lightning-ignited wildfires in Tasmania;['Amila M. K. Wickramasinghe', 'Lynda D. Prior', 'Grant J. Williamson', 'Matthias M. Boer', 'David M. J. S. Bowman'];Background Recent studies have reported increasing frequency of lightning fires and associated burned area in Tasmania.Aims To identify factors driving the frequency and scale of lightning-induced fires in Tasmania.Method We compiled datasets on lightning activity, lightning fire, vegetation and fuel moisture. Multi-model inference was used to evaluate predictors of lightning fire. We determined the number of days annually with fuel dry enough to be susceptible to lightning fires. We examined temporal trends in lightning, lightning fires and fuel moisture between 2005 and 2022.Key results Drier fuels and higher lightning density increased the probability of lightning fires, with areas of treeless vegetation being more susceptible than forests. Lightning fire-prone areas were concentrated in western and central Tasmania. However, no significant trends were found in lightning days or lightning fire days. There was a drying trend in fuel moisture in western and southern Tasmania, and a increasing wetness trend in northern and eastern regions.Conclusions and implications Lightning fires are most likely in treeless vegetation with dry fuels and those exposed to intense lightning activity. The short record limits detecting temporal trends. High-resolution data on fuel dryness, lightning and ignitions are crucial for understanding lightning fire dynamics.;2025/05/01;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24202;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24202
Insights on the dynamics of Miombo woody vegetation in Niassa Special Reserve, northern Mozambique;['Matola Salimo', 'Victorino Buramuge', 'Aide Farão', 'Aniceto Chauque', 'Romana Bandeira', 'Jone Fernando', 'Ana I. Ribeiro-Barros', 'Cristina Branquinho', 'Natasha Ribeiro'];Background Fire is a key ecological factor in the Miombo woodlands of southern Africa, but its role in tree dynamics has not been fully explored.Aim Investigate relationships between fire and forest dynamics and predict Miombo diameter distribution for the year 2033.Methods Tree data (growth, recruitment and mortality) were collected (2005, 2009, 2015 and 2019) along a fire frequency (ff) and severity (fs) gradient in 50 permanent plots in Niassa Special Reserve (NSR). A transition matrix was used to forecast forest structure for the year 2033.Main results Fire frequency (ff) and severity (fs) classes (low, medium and high) were associated with different tree species assemblages. High ff and fs had varied effects on tree mortality, recruitment, growth and carbon stocks. Julbernardia globiflora had higher mortality rate in high ff plots compared to other tree species. Projections indicated that, despite the regular distribution of diameter, high ff may reduce tree density in young cohorts.Conclusions A moderate fire regime is a determinant of sustaining the Miombo dynamics in NSR.Implications Fire management action through early dry season controlled burning is needed to prevent the impact of intense late dry season fire.;2025/04/25;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24060;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24060
The impacts of fire use in the Brazilian Amazon: a bibliometric analysis;['Amanda Kesley Cardozo Cancio', 'Mayerly Alexandra Guerrero-Moreno', 'Everton Cruz da Silva', 'Fernando Abreu Oliveira', 'Karina Dias-Silva', 'James Ferreira Moura Jr', 'Thiago Almeida Vieira', 'Lenize Batista Calvão', 'Leandro Juen', 'José Max Barbosa Oliveira-Junior'];The use of fire, essential in human evolution, has facilitated low-cost land management in the Amazon, albeit with significant environmental losses. Its uncontrolled use, exacerbated by climate change, intensifies environmental and socioeconomic challenges. This study explores the impacts of fire use in the Brazilian Amazon via bibliometric analysis, revealing trends, gaps and key areas of scientific relevance based on 192 articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science. Brazil has the highest scientific production (58%) and is a leader in scientific collaboration networks in this area. Topics such as ‘deforestation’ and ‘fire’ were central themes. Approximately 67% of studies focused on wildfires. The geographical distribution indicates that most studies (57%) are conducted on a regional scale, encompassing the entire Legal Amazon, and 15% focus on the state of Pará. The most common impacts associated with fire use in the Brazilian Amazon are ecological (35%). This study highlights the importance and complexity of the effects of fire use on the Amazon, underscoring the urgent need for policies that integrate sustainable management practices and fire governance. Promoting interdisciplinary research and collaboration among various societal sectors is essential to developing practical solutions protecting Amazonian biodiversity and communities.;2025/03/27;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24182;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24182
Comparing modeled soil temperature and moisture dynamics during prescribed fires, slash-pile burns and wildfires;['Peter R. Robichaud', 'William J. Massman', 'Anthony Bova', 'Antonio Girona-García', 'Andoni Alfaro-Leranoz', 'Nancy E. Gibson'];Background Wildfires, prescribed fires and slash-pile burns are disturbances that occur in many terrestrial ecosystems. Such fires produce variable surface heat fluxes causing a spectrum of effects on soil, such as seed mortality, nutrient loss, changes in microbial activity and water repellency. Accurately modeling soil heating is vital to predicting these second-order fire effects. The process-based Massman HMV (Heat–Moisture–Vapor) model incorporates soil water evaporation, heat transport and water vapor movement, and captures the observed rapid evaporation of soil moisture.Aims Improve the Massman HMV model and compare it with Campbell soil heating model using four independent soil temperature datasets collected during burning.Methods The models were evaluated using similar BFD curves against observed temperature and soil moisture using standard statistical methods.Key results Results suggest reasonable agreement between the Massman HMV model and field soil temperature data under various burn scenarios and it was consistently more accurate than the Campbell model.Conclusions The Massman HMV model improved soil heating predictions and provided soil moisture predictions.Implications The Massman HMV model was incorporated in the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM ver. 6.7) with a user-friendly interface that allows managers to assess the heating impacts of fire on soil temperature and moisture.;2025/03/27;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF22082;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF22082
Numerical investigation of the effect of wind, slope and fuel moisture on the radiative and convective heating of excelsior fuels;['M. S. Sadeghi', 'Maryam Ghodrat', 'Duncan Sutherland', 'Albert Simeoni', 'Jason Sharples', 'Harald Kleine'];Background Wind, slope angle and moisture content are the three major parameters that affect fire rate of spread and heat transfer in propagating bushfires.Aims This study investigates the effect of the slope angle (0°–40°), wind speed (0–3ms−1) and fuel moisture content (FMC, 4–12%) on convective heat transfer (cooling and heating) and radiative heat transfer of burning excelsior fuel particles at different locations downstream of a spreading fire.Methods The simulations were conducted using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). The zone located downstream of the fire front was divided into two regions: the flame-induced region and the natural convection region.Key results For uplifted flames, there is convective cooling of particles downstream of the flame region. However, when the flame attaches to the unburnt fuel, flame depth and fire line intensity both increase, and there is convective heating of the particles ahead of the flames. Radiative heating of the particles also decreases consistently as the distance from the flame increases.Implications The results of this analysis reveal the mechanism of local convective and radiative heat transfer to downstream vegetation. Although heat transfer mechanisms are identified from this numerical analysis, these need to be verified through experimental work.;2025/03/24;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24115;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24115
Burning poop: chemical composition and carbon dynamics of large herbivore dung burned in African savanna fires;['C. Sánchez-García', 'C. Santín', 'T. Strydom', 'X. L. Otero', 'S. H. Doerr'];Background Fire and herbivores are essential to savanna ecosystems, consuming vegetation and recycling nutrients. Fire volatilises some elements and makes others readily available through ash, while herbivores redistribute nutrients via dung (excrement, faeces).Aims We investigate, for the first time, fire’s role in consuming dung and affecting nutrient cycling.Methods We examined the chemical characteristics of wild large herbivore dung (buffalo, elephant, giraffe, wildebeest, zebra) burned during African savanna fires (Kruger National Park, South Africa) and estimated carbon and nutrients losses from dung burning.Key results Smouldering combustion of dung led to high carbon loss to the atmosphere (C: 41% and 4.1% in unburned and burned dung) and high enrichment of nutrients (e.g. Ca, P) and metals (e.g. Cu, Fe, Zn) in the burned residue. Flaming combustion of grass resulted in lower carbon loss (C: 43% and 23% in vegetation and ash), leaving more carbon in the ash and lower relative enrichment of other nutrients and metals.Conclusions Burned dung forms nutrient hotspots with physicochemical characteristics distinct from vegetation ash.Implications Taking dung from wild or domestic herbivores into account in fuel inventories can improve estimations of fire-related carbon emissions and provide better understanding of fire impacts on nutrients cycling.;2025/03/18;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24162;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24162
Reburning pyrogenic organic matter: a laboratory method for dosing dynamic heat fluxes from above;['Mengmeng Luo', 'Kara Yedinak', 'Keith Bourne', 'Thea Whitman'];Background Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) represents a relatively persistent component of soil carbon stocks. Although subsequent fires have the potential to combust or alter preexisting PyOM stocks, simulating soil heating faces important methodological constraints. In particular, methods for estimating the effects of subsequent fire on preexisting PyOM in soil have important limitations.Aims We aimed to design a laboratory method to effectively simulate soil heating from above, to investigate the impacts of subsequent fires on PyOM at different soil depths while addressing key limitations of previous methods.Methods Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) log burns were used to parameterise realistic heat flux profiles. Using a cone calorimeter, these profiles were applied to buried jack pine PyOM to simulate variable reburn fire intensities.Key results In general, higher heat fluxes and shallower depths led to more mass loss of PyOM.Conclusions We offer a method to simulate specific soil heating profiles. Conditions that result in higher temperatures (higher heat fluxes and shallower depths) are likely to lead to more loss of PyOM in subsequent fires.Implications The method could simulate different fire scenarios to represent spatial variability within a given fire event, or to study the effects of fire on different types of biomass, or organisms such as microbes.;2025/03/18;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24128;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24128
Fire weather severity in southern Africa is increasing faster and more extensively in the late than in the early dry season;['Sílvia Catarino', 'João M. N. Silva', 'Alana K. Neves', 'Duarte Oom', 'José M. C. Pereira'];Background In African savannas, the most intense fires occur during the late dry season, when fuel availability is high and atmospheric relative humidity low. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) system has been used to measure the effort required for fire suppression and explore the impact of climate on fires.Aims This study assesses trends in FWI system indices from 1979 to 2022 and their influence on burned area (BA).Methods We employed the Theil–Sen slope estimator and contextual Mann–Kendall test to evaluate the presence of significant trends in FWI system indices during the early dry season (EDS) and late dry season (LDS), and assessed how trends in BA depend on fire weather.Key results We found distinct patterns in fire weather trends between the EDS and LDS, the LDS showing more widespread areas of increasing trends. However, only 28% of the regression analyses showed significant relationships with BA, suggesting a moderate influence of the FWI system on BA interannual variance.Conclusions Fire weather severity is increasing faster and more extensively during the LDS than the EDS. Additional factors play a significant role in shaping BA trends. Proactively managing anthropogenic fires during the moister EDS can help mitigate fire intensity, reduce emissions and support biodiversity conservation efforts.;2025/03/13;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24002;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24002
Burning from the ground up: the structure and impact of Prescribed Burn Associations in the United States;['Alison Deak', 'Jennifer E. Fawcett', 'Lenya Quinn-Davidson', 'Christopher Adlam', 'John R. Weir', 'Jeffery Stackhouse'];Background To combat losses and threats from fire exclusion and extreme wildfire events, communities in the United States are increasingly self-organizing through locally led Prescribed Burn Associations (PBAs) to plan and implement prescribed burns on private lands.Aim Our study aimed to document the expansion of PBAs and provide insight into their structure, function, and impacts.Methods Leaders from 135 known PBAs across the United States were invited to participate in an online survey.Key results Survey results demonstrate a widespread emergence of PBAs in the United States, successfully mobilizing thousands of volunteers to collectively burn more than 34,000ha annually.Conclusions PBAs demonstrated that they are reducing myriad barriers to prescribed burning while meeting their goals to broaden access to the use of fire using a neighbors-helping-neighbors model to provide training, pool resources, and reduce the costs of prescribed burning. By including volunteers with diverse levels of experience and backgrounds, PBAs are changing the narrative of who has access to the use of fire.Implications The adaptability of the PBA model to local contexts provides an alternative model of community-led, non-agency-based fire management critical to advancing the pace and scale of restoration needed in fire-adapted ecosystems.;2025/03/11;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24178;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24178
A bottom–up savanna fire fuel consumption inventory and its application to savanna burning in Kafue National Park, Zambia;['Tom Eames', 'Adrian Kaluka', 'Roland Vernooij', 'Cameron Yates', 'Jeremy Russell-Smith', 'Guido R. van der Werf'];Background Tropical savannas are the most extensively and frequently burned biome worldwide. To establish accurate emissions inventories for burning in tropical savannas, detailed biomass information is required. Available pan-tropical or global biomass maps currently focus on standing vegetation and largely ignore surface layers, a key component of fuel consumption in the tropics.Aims In this paper, we propose a methodology for building a high-resolution regional bottom–up fuel inventory, and examine the effectiveness thereof in a local scale case study in Kafue National Park, Zambia.Methods We scaled up fuel measurements using drone-mounted cameras and Sentinel-2 imagery. We examined inter-annual fire variability’s effects on emissions.Key results The fuel model performs well for surface level fuel, with an error margin of ~±27%. Accuracy is reduced when mapping more stochastic fuel layers such as coarse woody debris, or fuel layers with a structural component.Conclusions Current pyrogenic emissions models underestimate emissions from Kafue National Park.Implications Timing of burning is an important factor for total burned area as well as for emissions.;2025/02/28;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24121;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24121
Experimental investigation of fire behaviours and heat transfer in single cypress tree crown fires;['Hanwen Guo', 'Yunji Gao', 'Ziqun Ye', 'Zhengyuan Yang', 'Yuchun Zhang', 'Zijian Lei', 'Ao Sun'];Background Crown fires are among the most perilous and challenging types of forest fires to combat, posing a significant hazard to forest ecosystems and the wildland–urban interface.Methods Crown fire experiments were carried out using cypress trees with five different crown heights from 0.4 to 1.2m to investigate the fire behaviours and heat transfer mechanisms.Key results and conclusions The characteristic values of flame height, mass loss rate and heat flux increased with crown height, whereas flame width increased with crown width. Empirical correlations of mass loss rates were established. Flame temperature varied with flame height and relationships between these were developed based on four dimensionless temperature zones. Flame emissivity was related to crown height and increased exponentially with the heat release rate. This study proposes a modified model to predict the radiation heat flux from crown fires, taking the variations of flame temperature and flame emissivity into account.Implications The findings of this work enhance understanding of fire behaviours and controlling mechanisms of crown fire under different crown heights, and also improve the accuracy of prediction of wildland fire development and spread in the wildland–urban interface.;2025/02/25;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24030;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24030
Pattern recognition and modelling of virulent wildfires in Spain;['María Bugallo', 'María Dolores Esteban', 'Manuel Francisco Marey-Pérez', 'Domingo Morales'];Background Driven by global warming and land use, fire dynamics are changing worldwide, increasing fire activity and its impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and human settlements. In southern European countries, large forest fires are increasing annually and a high spatio-temporal concentration has been shown to overwhelm fire suppression systems.Aims Propose sound statistical criteria for grouping fire ignitions based on auxiliary information.Methods Our methodology combines pattern recognition and complex statistical modelling that, by capturing underlying dependencies and adapting to the nature of the data, provides a reliable statistical basis for formulating firefighting strategies.Key results Weekly and provincial data from 2007 to 2015 are used to illustrate the performance of the procedures.Conclusions Research indicates that weather conditions, the simultaneous occurrence of events and the proximity of urban areas contribute to making the Spanish landscape highly susceptible to wildfires in summer.Implications Risk mapping is key to fire management and efficient resource allocation.;2025/02/24;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23162;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23162

Factors enabling fire management outcomes in Indigenous Savanna fire management projects in Western Australia;['Tom Vigilante', 'Catherine Goonack', 'Desmond Williams', 'Aidan Joseph', 'Leigh-Ann Woolley', 'Rohan Fisher'];Background Balanggarra, Dambimangari, Wilinggin and Wunambal Gaambera Traditional Owners in Western Australia operate Savanna Fire Management projects under the collective North Kimberley Fire Abatement Project.Aims We examine changes to the fire regime before and after the initiation of these projects and discuss implications for incentivising savanna fire management.Methods Using established methods and high-resolution imagery, we compared fire metrics between baseline (2001–2011) and project years (2012–2022).Key results Fire seasonality notably shifted from late to early dry season dominance with fewer late season fires across, resulting in carbon abatement. While total area burnt remained similar, annual fire pattern transitioned from a cyclical to less variable regime. Fire patchiness, fire age diversity, and area of long unburnt vegetation increased while fire frequency decreased. A minimum of 4years of fire management was required before significant changes in fire metrics were observed.Conclusions The fire regime on Traditional Owner lands has improved significantly, enabled by the emergence of land and sea management, carbon markets, support of partner agencies, and the securing of land rights.Implications Beyond carbon credits, access to technology holds promise for sustained improvements to adaptive fire management built on strong foundations of traditional burning practices.;2024/08/30;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24092;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24092
Remote sensing applications for prescribed burn research;['Anna LoPresti', 'Meghan T. Hayden', 'Katherine Siegel', 'Benjamin Poulter', 'E. Natasha Stavros', 'Laura E. Dee'];Prescribed burning is a key management strategy within fire-adapted systems, and improved monitoring approaches are needed to evaluate its effectiveness in achieving social-ecological outcomes. Remote sensing provides opportunities to analyse the impacts of prescribed burning, yet a comprehensive understanding of the applications of remote sensing for prescribed burn research is lacking. We conduct a literature review of 120 peer-reviewed publications to synthesise the research aims, methodologies, limitations and future directions of remote sensing for the analysis of prescribed fire. Studies evaluating management outcomes found prescribed burning effective for wildfire risk reduction, yet few analysed co-benefits or trade-offs with other management goals. Most studies use passive, spaceborne, low spatial resolution sensors, characterised in the literature as consistent and accessible data sources but limited in detecting small, low-severity and short-duration fires characteristic of prescribed burns. In contrast, active remote sensing approaches including LiDAR are less frequently employed, but show promise for highly accurate, spatially explicit 3D vegetation and fuel load mapping. Remote sensing advances toward higher spatial resolution, more frequent revisit, denser spectral sampling and more data across the electromagnetic spectrum are critical to advancing prescribed fire research, addressing current methodological gaps, and improving fuels and fire management capacity.;2024/05/24;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23130;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23130
Future fire events are likely to be worse than climate projections indicate – these are some of the reasons why;['Mika Peace', 'Lachlan McCaw'];Background Climate projections signal longer fire seasons and an increase in the number of dangerous fire weather days for much of the world including Australia.Aims Here we argue that heatwaves, dynamic fire–atmosphere interactions and increased fuel availability caused by drought will amplify potential fire behaviour well beyond projections based on calculations of afternoon forest fire danger derived from climate models.Methods We review meteorological dynamics contributing to enhanced fire behaviour during heatwaves, drawing on examples of dynamical processes driving fire behaviour during the Australian Black Summer bushfires of 2019–20.Results Key dynamical processes identified include: nocturnal low-level jets, deep, unstable planetary boundary layers and fire–atmosphere coupling.Conclusions The future scenario we contend is long windows of multi-day fire events where overnight suppression is less effective and fire perimeters will expand continuously and aggressively over multiple days and nights.Implications Greater overnight fire activity and multi-day events present strategic and tactical challenges for fire management agencies including having to expand resourcing for overnight work, manage personnel fatigue and revise training to identify conditions conducive to unusually active fire behaviour overnight. Effective messaging will be critical to minimise accidental fire ignition during heatwaves and to alert the community to the changing fire environment;2024/06/19;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23138;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23138
Numerical investigation of the effect of wind, slope and fuel moisture on the radiative and convective heating of excelsior fuels;['M. S.

The process-based Massman HMV (Heat–Moisture–Vapor) model incorporates soil water evaporation, heat transport and water vapor movement, and captures the observed rapid evaporation of soil moisture.Aims Improve the Massman HMV model and compare it with Campbell soil heating model using four independent soil temperature datasets collected during burning.Methods The models were evaluated using similar BFD curves against observed temperature and soil moisture using standard statistical methods.Key results Results suggest reasonable agreement between the Massman HMV model and field soil temperature data under various burn scenarios and it was consistently more accurate than the Campbell model.Conclusions The Massman HMV model improved soil heating predictions and provided soil moisture predictions.Implications The Massman HMV model was incorporated in the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM ver. 6.7) with a user-friendly interface that allows managers to assess the heating impacts of fire on soil temperature and moisture.;2025/03/27;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF22082;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF22082
Wildland fire evacuations in Canada from 1980 to 2021;['Amy Cardinal Christianson', 'Lynn M. Johnston', 'Jacqueline A. Oliver', 'David Watson', 'David Young', 'Heather MacDonald', 'John Little', 'Bruce Macnab', 'Noemie Gonzalez Bautista'];Background Every year, people in Canada are evacuated due to wildland fires to avoid death, injury, and illness from fire and smoke events.Aims In this paper, we provide an overview of evacuations recorded in the Canadian Wildland Fire Evacuation Database between 1980 and 2021.Methods Our analysis covers evacuations in Canada from 1980 to 2021. We provide summary statistics including number of evacuations and evacuees, evacuation duration, seasonality, evacuation causes, community types, structure losses, and fatalities. We also investigate temporal and spatial patterns.Key results Between 1980 and 2021, there were 1393 wildland fire evacuation events with 576,747 people evacuated. During this period, there was an overall increase in frequency of evacuations, number of evacuees, and duration of events. Structure loss occurred during 194 evacuation events, with 4105 homes burned. We estimate wildland fire evacuations cost at least CAD3.7billion (excluding structural losses), jumping to CAD4.6billion if we include productivity losses. Indigenous peoples are disproportionately impacted in wildfire evacuations compared to the general Canadian population.Conclusions Wildland fire evacuations continue to occur across Canada and are increasing.Implications The findings from this study give us a better understanding of the characteristics of wildland fire evacuations, which can help guide emergency management.;2024/06/18;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23097;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23097
Characterising spatial clusters of forest fire activity in the Western Himalayan region of India: implications for conservation and management;['Shanti Kumari', 'Shailja Mamgain', 'Arijit Roy', 'H. C. Prince'];Background Forest fires in Western Himalaya have exhibited changing patterns over past years due to climatic change and human activities. Understanding these fire patterns is essential for developing effective conservation and management strategies.Aim This study characterises spatial clusters of forest fires and analyses their spatio-temporal patterns across Western Himalaya using long-term data (2005–2022) on fire events, burned area and climatic variables.Method The study employs Getis-Ord Gi* and Anselin Local Moran’s I statistics to identify significant spatial clusters of forest fire activity. Furthermore, time-series analysis combined with the Mann–Kendall test are utilised to evaluate the relationship between fire events and climatic and edaphic variables.Key result Analysis revealed statistically significant clusters of forest fires concentrated in low to mid-elevation regions, which comprise 27–32% of total forest area. These burned areas are primarily located in Uttarakhand and parts of Himachal Pradesh, particularly in the central and south-eastern districts of Pauri and Tehri, indicating a heightened risk of forest fires.Conclusion Identification of forest fire clusters and the assessment of contributing factors provide crucial insights into the underlying causes of their activity in the Western Himalaya.Implication Findings of this study will be instrumental in developing targeted mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable ecological resources in Western Himalaya.;2025/02/20;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23163;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23163
An offline coupling of fire spread models to simulate the 2021 Marshall Fire;['Fernando Szasdi-Bardales', 'Kasra Shamsaei', 'Timothy W. Juliano', 'Branko Kosovic', 'Hamed Ebrahimian', 'Negar Elhami-Khorasani'];Background Existing fire spread models focus exclusively on wildland or urban fire simulation.Aims This study aims at an offline coupling of two fire spread models to enable a continuous simulation of a wildfire incident transitioning from wildland into wildland–urban interface (WUI) communities, evaluate the effects of wind input on simulation results and study the influence of building types on fire spread patterns.Methods The selected models are WRF-Fire, a wildland fire behaviour simulation platform, and SWUIFT, a model for fire spread inside the WUI. The 2021 Marshall Fire serves as the case study. A map of the fire’s timeline and location is generated using public information. Three simulation scenarios are analysed to study the effects of wind input resolution and building type on the predicted fire spread and damage.Key results The most accurate results are obtained using a high-resolution wind input and when incorporating different building types.Conclusions The offline coupling of models provides a reliable solution for fire spread simulation. Fire-resistant buildings likely helped limit community fire spread during the Marshall Fire.Implications The research is a first step toward developing simulation capabilities to predict the spread of wildfires within the wildland, WUI and urban environments.;2025/01/23;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24027;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24027
Burning poop: chemical composition and carbon dynamics of large herbivore dung burned in African savanna fires;['C. Sánchez-García', 'C. Santín', 'T. Strydom', 'X. L. Otero', 'S. H. Doerr'];Background Fire and herbivores are essential to savanna ecosystems, consuming vegetation and recycling nutrients. Fire volatilises some elements and makes others readily available through ash, while herbivores redistribute nutrients via dung (excrement, faeces).Aims We investigate, for the first time, fire’s role in consuming dung and affecting nutrient cycling.Methods We examined the chemical characteristics of wild large herbivore dung (buffalo, elephant, giraffe, wildebeest, zebra) burned during African savanna fires (Kruger National Park, South Africa) and estimated carbon and nutrients losses from dung burning.Key results Smouldering combustion of dung led to high carbon loss to the atmosphere (C: 41% and 4.1% in unburned and burned dung) and high enrichment of nutrients (e.g. Ca, P) and metals (e.g. Cu, Fe, Zn) in the burned residue. Flaming combustion of grass resulted in lower carbon loss (C: 43% and 23% in vegetation and ash), leaving more carbon in the ash and lower relative enrichment of other nutrients and metals.Conclusions Burned dung forms nutrient hotspots with physicochemical characteristics distinct from vegetation ash.Implications Taking dung from wild or domestic herbivores into account in fuel inventories can improve estimations of fire-related carbon emissions and provide better understanding of fire impacts on nutrients cycling.;2025/03/18;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24162;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24162
Fire weather severity in southern Africa is increasing faster and more extensively in the late than in the early dry season;['Sílvia Catarino', 'João M. N. Silva', 'Alana K. Neves', 'Duarte Oom', 'José M. C. Pereira'];Background In African savannas, the most intense fires occur during the late dry season, when fuel availability is high and atmospheric relative humidity low. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) system has been used to measure the effort required for fire suppression and explore the impact of climate on fires.Aims This study assesses trends in FWI system indices from 1979 to 2022 and their influence on burned area (BA).Methods We employed the Theil–Sen slope estimator and contextual Mann–Kendall test to evaluate the presence of significant trends in FWI system indices during the early dry season (EDS) and late dry season (LDS), and assessed how trends in BA depend on fire weather.Key results We found distinct patterns in fire weather trends between the EDS and LDS, the LDS showing more widespread areas of increasing trends. However, only 28% of the regression analyses showed significant relationships with BA, suggesting a moderate influence of the FWI system on BA interannual variance.Conclusions Fire weather severity is increasing faster and more extensively during the LDS than the EDS. Additional factors play a significant role in shaping BA trends. Proactively managing anthropogenic fires during the moister EDS can help mitigate fire intensity, reduce emissions and support biodiversity conservation efforts.;2025/03/13;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24002;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24002
Integrating an urban fire model into an operational wildland fire model to simulate one dimensional wildland–urban interface fires: a parametric study;['Dwi M. J. Purnomo', 'Yiren Qin', 'Maria Theodori', 'Maryam Zamanialaei', 'Chris Lautenberger', 'Arnaud Trouvé', 'Michael J. Gollner'];Background Wildland fires that occur near communities, in the wildland–urban interface (WUI), can inflict significant damage to urban structures. Although computational models are vital in wildfires, they often focus solely on wildland landscapes.Aim We conducted a computational study to investigate WUI fire spread, encompassing both urban and wildland landscapes.Methods We developed a 1D landscape-scale semi-physical model by integrating a semi-physical urban fire spread model into an Eulerian level set model of wildfire. The model includes ignition and spread through radiation, direct flame contact and ember deposition.Key results Through a parametric study, we compare the relative change of spread rate from various structural properties and landscape layouts represented by model parameters, highlighting the significant impact of fire-resistant structure materials over surface treatments. Layout configurations play a pivotal role in fire spread, with isolated islands of combustibles effective in reducing spread rate, aligning with existing mitigation strategies.Conclusion Despite using a 1D domain and limitations on spatial and temporal variability, our model provides insights into underlying phenomena observed in WUI fires and their mitigation. It offers early-stage development of strategies for managing structure materials and landscape layouts.Implications Our model and findings provide insights into WUI fire dynamics, paving the way for advanced mitigation strategies.;2024/10/18;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24102;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24102
Fire for the future: governance of market-based savanna fire management projects in Arnhem Land, northern Australia;['Taegan Calnan', 'Dean Yibarbuk', 'Jeremy Russell-Smith'];Background Developing effective participatory community-based governance is a key challenge for delivering equitable outcomes in market-based carbon and ecosystem services projects.Aim To explore Indigenous participants’ perspectives concerning implementation of representative community-based governance model for the longest running and largest market-based savanna fire management (SFM) project in northern Australia, the Arnhem Land Fire Abatement (ALFA) projects.Methods The study employed semi-structured interviews conducted between 2020–2022 exploring governance priorities and outcomes with 20 Indigenous participants occupying ALFA project leadership positions.Key results The ALFA governance model, involving participation of Indigenous Ranger Groups (IRGs) and representation of traditional Landowners as Directors on an entirely Indigenous-led Board, was considered to provide effective SFM project oversight and broader community acceptance. Identified benefits included supporting local cultural fire and land management responsibilities, regional networking, collective decision-making for benefit-sharing arrangements. Expressed concerns included potential for external IRG hosting institutions to diminish decision-making responsibilities of traditional Landowners, and preference for local IRG’s to strengthen links to traditional Landowners to promote broad community benefits.Conclusions The principles of the Indigenous representative and participatory ALFA governance model serve as an instructive example for local communities in other regional settings seeking to leverage emergent development opportunities through ecosystem service economies.;2024/11/21;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24129;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24129
Short-term impacts of operational fuel treatments on modelled fire behaviour and effects in seasonally dry forests of British Columbia, Canada;['Kea H. Rutherford', ' Bianca N. I. Eskelson', ' Lori D. Daniels', ' Valerie LeMay', ' Gregory A. Greene', 'Robert W. Gray'];"Background In response to increasing risk of extreme wildfire across western North America, forest managers are proactively implementing fuel treatments.Aims We assessed the efficacy of alternative combinations of thinning, pruning and residue fuel management to mitigate potential fire behaviour and effects in seasonally dry forests of interior British Columbia, Canada.Methods Across five community forests, we measured stand attributes before and after fuel treatments in 2021 and 2022, then modelled fire behaviour and effects using the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator.Key results For our study area, field measurements combined with fire behaviour modelling indicated: (1) low-intensity thinning from below reduced potential of passive crown fire, whereas high-intensity thinning reduced potential of passive and active crown fire; (2) pruning after thinning from below did not further reduce potential of passive crown fire; and (3) chipping or pile burning of residue fuel mitigated potential of passive crown fire, but fire effects associated with chipping remain a concern.Conclusions and implications There is limited prior research on the impacts of fuel treatments in western Canada. This research contributes to better understanding the potential impacts of fuel treatments in the fire-prone forests of interior British Columbia.";2025/02/05;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24096;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24096
Simulating wildfire spread based on continuous time series remote sensing images and cellular automata;['Huajian Zhuang', 'Naian Liu', 'Xiaodong Xie', 'Xuan Xu', 'Mengmeng Li', 'Yang Zhang', 'Rui Wang'];"Background Acquiring behaviour parameters of wildfire propagation and developing firefighting strategies necessitate a precise and efficient simulation method; fireline coordinates and rate of spread (ROS) are two crucial parameters closely associated with simulation precision.Aims This study proposes an adaptive simulation method for wildfire propagation by integrating continuous time series remote sensing images with a cellular automata (CA) model.Methods The ROS in each direction is calculated using continuous time fireline coordinates derived from multi-source remote sensing images. A time-adaptive propagation algorithm is developed based on the CA model (time-adaptive cellular automata, TCA). Vegetation distribution information is derived to establish a simulation system for verification experiments.Key results The TCA model demonstrated satisfactory simulation performance, with a prediction accuracy of 92.2% for burned area and 87.3% for fireline length within local regions in the MuLi Forest Fire and effectively characterised gradual spread based on low ROS.Conclusion The adaptive simulation method produces fairly precise results and demonstrated its capability to achieve localised and gradual propagation. This software serves as a powerful tool for wildland surface fire prevention and control.Implications The adaptive simulation method based on continuous time remote sensing images and the CA model are essential for accurately predicting wildfire propagation.";2025/01/16;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24130;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24130
The potential of using magnetic susceptibility to identify past wildfires in Australia;['Annika V. Herbert'];Fully understanding the causes and frequency of wildfires has never been more important than it is today, with potentially thousands of lives at risk from wildfire smoke in Australia alone. Until now wildfire frequency in Australia has been estimated based solely on observed fire events, records that barely cover the last century. This coverage is severely inadequate for a reliable estimation of wildfire frequency. Here, it is suggested that records of magnetic susceptibility may help extend the wildfire records used, which will significantly increase the confidence level of estimated wildfire frequency. With Australian soils being rich in iron, the main factor limiting the use of magnetic susceptibility appears to be rainfall. Additionally, the magnetic susceptibility records of several sites may respond more to local hydrology or organic matter content than to wildfires, possibly owing to insufficient heating of the soil. A comprehensive field study is thereby suggested, which will determine which site characteristics have the most significant influence on magnetic susceptibility records in Australia. This will enable more detailed studies to be conducted and will extend Australia’s fire records.;2025/02/14;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24093;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24093
The influence of wildfire risk reduction programs and practices on recreation visitation;['Eric M. White', 'Samantha G. Winder', 'Spencer A. Wood'];Background The increasing extent and severity of uncharacteristic wildfire has prompted numerous policies and programs promoting landscape-scale fuels reduction.Aims We used novel data sources to measure how recreation was influenced by fuels reduction efforts under the US Forest Service Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration (CFLR) Program.Methods We used posts to four social media platforms to estimate the number of social media user-days within CFLR landscapes and asked: (1) did visitation within CFLR Program landscapes between 2012 and 2020 change in a manner consistent with the pattern on nearby lands, and (2) was there a relationship between the magnitudes of specific fuel treatment activities within CFLR landscapes and visitation to that landscape?Key results In aggregate, visitation to the CFLR landscapes changed at a rate mirroring the trend observed elsewhere. Within CFLR landscapes, pre-commercial thinning and pruning had slight positive influences on visitation whereas prescribed burning and managed wildfire had slight negative influences.Conclusions Fuel treatments can have a modest influence on visitation, but we didnot find any wholesale changes in visitation within CFLR landscapes.Implications Social media and other novel data sources offer an opportunity to fill in gaps in empirical data on recreation to better understand social-ecological system linkages.;2024/11/28;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF24036;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF24036
A comment on the use of visually assessed fuel hazard ratings and scores for Australian fire management and research;['Miguel G. Cruz'];Background Assessment of fuel hazard has become the dominant method of describing Australian forest fuel complexes, despite a lack of evidence supporting the veracity of its underpinning assumptions.Aims To analyse and discuss the merits of fuel hazard ratings and scores in representing measurable fuel characteristics, such as fuel load and fire behaviour potential.Methods Published findings were reviewed, and available data analysed to investigate the validity of the Australian fuel hazard assessment concepts.Key results Multiple published studies showed the Australian fuel hazard assessment methods to be subjective and non-replicable. All available evidence shows no relationship between fuel hazard ratings and fuel quantity. No relationship between the ratings and fire behaviour potential was found.Conclusions The principles underpinning the use of fuel hazard ratings for fuel assessment were shown to be unfounded. The ratings cannot be converted into physical fuel characteristics or fire behaviour potential, and its application in Australian fire management is unwarranted.;2024/07/02;International Journal of Wildland Fire;10.1071/WF23164;https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF23164
Population structure, growth and reproduction in two species of Tympanocryptis (Agamidae);['Lyn Nelson', 'Paul D. Cooper'];Two threatened species of Tympanocryptis (T. lineata and T. osbornei) (the grassland earless dragon clade) are compared for population structure, growth and reproduction from sites around the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and near Cooma in New South Wales (NSW). Both species showed similar proportions of adults, intermediates and juveniles, as well as similar proportions of adult males and females. Growth patterns had a rapid increase in snout–vent length (SVL) in juveniles. Predicted adult SVL was the same in both species, and females in both species had greater SVL than males. In one year, the appearance of juveniles in the populations was later in T. osbornei than in T. lineata, but that may have been a result of cooler temperatures in the austral summer. Body condition was slightly better in adults of T. osbornei than T. lineata as the former were heavier and shorter. Longevity in the field was similar for both species, being slightly greater than two years, but reproduction may have occurred only once during their lifetime. Colouration associated with reproduction appeared to be the same for both species. Future work can use this information to determine how populations of Tympanocryptis sp. vary in response to environmental changes.;2025/05/01;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24034;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24034
Determination of population age structure from the survivorship of individuals of unknown ages in unicorns and platypuses;['J. W. Macgregor', 'P. A. Fleming', 'O. Wade', 'R. Donaldson', 'K. S. Warren'];Population age structure is an important parameter for wildlife population modelling. However, for many species it is not possible to accurately assess the age of adult individuals. We present a hypothetical example to illustrate a previously described method of determining population age structure from the survivorship of individuals of unknown ages that to our knowledge is unused in the fields of zoology and ecology. We then apply this method to data collected over 10years for a population of wild platypuses (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), a species whose adult individuals cannot be accurately aged and for which only limited data on life history characteristics are available. Our results show a lower mortality rate over the first years of life of platypuses than the one previous study available for comparison, and suggested a Type I or Type III survivorship curve.;2025/03/28;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24027;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24027
A northernmost occurrence record of Shepherd’s beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi) – a molecular identification from Exmouth, Western Australia;['Melissa A. Millar', 'Kelly A. Waples', 'Holly C. Raudino', 'Kym Ottewell'];Shepherd’s beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi) is one of the least known beaked whales. Its distribution has been described as circumpolar, between latitudes 26°S and 50°S in the Southern Hemisphere based on scarce at-sea sightings and strandings. In March 2024, the remains of a cetacean were found in the Jurabi Coastal Park in North West Cape, Western Australia, 21°48′S, 114°06′E. Heavy predation on the carcass did not allow morphological identification. DNA sequencing was used to verify its identity as T. shepherdi, representing a 600km extension to the previous northernmost record for this species.;2025/03/17;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24033;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24033
GPS tracking informs nest reserve design for an endangered raptor, the grey goshawk (Tachyspiza novaehollandiae), in hostile anthropogenic landscapes;['David A. Young', 'James B. Kirkpatrick'];We used GPS telemetry to investigate space use and movements of 15 grey goshawks (Tachyspiza novaehollandiae) in south-east Tasmania, Australia, between 2021 and 2023. The number of nests per territory in 73 active breeding territories was also determined and inter-nest distances were calculated. Mean minimum convex polygon (MCP) non-breeding season home range size of female goshawks was more than twice as large as the mean breeding season home range size. Home range size of males was similar in the breeding and non-breeding seasons and the MCP estimates suggest their home ranges are much larger than that of females. Tracked goshawks were range residents throughout the year with kernel density (KD) core areas centred on nest trees and preferred foraging locations. Movement patterns were highly recursive although some individuals occasionally undertook long range excursions away from their nests. Mean number of nests per goshawk breeding territory was 2.0 (range 1–6). Median distance between nests in breeding territories was 78.0m (range 1.8–915.0m). We recommend that prescriptive nest reserves for grey goshawks be implemented based on our 50%, 75% and 95% KD core area estimates for females in the breeding season. We provide a conceptualised example of a nest reserve design.;2025/03/14;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24025;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24025
Population differentiation in the white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) at a continental scale: implications for dispersal, biogeography and conservation;['Richard E. Major', 'Georgina M. Schlub', 'Rebecca N. Johnson', 'Andrew G. King', 'Gretel S. Major'];The capacity for dispersal is an important determinant of a species’ resilience to decline from the serial extinction of local populations. Dispersal of animals can be difficult to measure directly but population genetics provides a powerful tool for identifying dispersal limits. This study used microsatellite markers to investigate population structuring of the white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) across its geographic range. Because the species is threatened in the north-eastern part of its range, the primary aim was to identify barriers limiting dispersal. Isolation by distance was not apparent across the 3000km mainland range but populations on three oceanic islands, and two mainland sites surrounded by urbanisation, were genetically distinct from each other and the other mainland sites. The small populations that were surrounded by urbanised land had significantly lower genetic diversity (allelic diversity and heterozygosity) than the other mainland populations, with the oceanic island populations showing intermediate levels of diversity. These results suggest that although being a partially nomadic species, which facilitates its dispersal over continuous habitat, the species does not have the flight capacity of some other small passerines and is sensitive to habitat discontinuity. Populations inhabiting small areas of coastal saltmarsh in areas with large human populations are likely to face increasing threat levels.;2025/03/07;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24037;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24037
Rocky landform specialists of the Mount Isa Inlier: camera trapping reveals seasonal occupancy and habitat associations of a unique faunal assemblage in an ancient landscape;['Jarrad C. Barnes', 'Elizabeth A. Brunton', 'Mark G. Sanders', 'Christofer J. Clemente'];Rocky landforms offer a complex and persistent habitat for a diverse range of fauna. The Mount Isa Inlier bioregion of north-west Queensland is dominated by such landforms, but the faunal assemblage inhabiting them has received scant attention. We conducted a 13-month camera trap study at 60 camera stations, totalling 21,965 camera days, aimed at detecting the faunal assemblage present on these landforms. We categorised each identified taxon as either a rocky landform specialist or non-specialist. We identified 15 specialists and implemented a multiseason community occupancy model for 12 of these to assess how they utilised rocky landforms over the course of a year, and according to a suite of environmental characteristics. Rates of use of rocky landforms increased in November and decreased in April. At the community level we found higher rates of use of south and west slopes than north slopes, higher rates of use of rocky hills than jumpups, and higher rates of use of metamorphic and igneous geologies than sedimentary ones. We provide the first evidence of this unique community’s use of the landscape through both space and time and highlight broad site characteristics of candidate areas in which to focus future management and conservation initiatives.;2025/03/03;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24030;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24030
The reliability of latex weak links on radio collars used to track eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus);['Tian Chen', 'Naomi Davis', 'Pam Whiteley', 'Lee F. Skerratt', 'Charles El-Hage', 'Jasmin Hufschmid'];"Telemetry neck collars are commonly used to collect spatial data on free ranging animals. Two major challenges in application are entanglement prevention and retrieval of the collars after the study. Weak links made of a degradable material that breaks down while deployed on the animal are a potential solution to reduce entanglement and prevent the need to capture or sedate animals for retrieval. However, weak links can perform inconsistently depending on an animal’s behaviour and environmental factors such as heat and humidity. A study of disease in eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) in Victoria, Australia, provided an opportunity to test the performance of 35 radio collars fitted with a latex weak link between May and July 2022. At the conclusion of the study, 20 collars were manually removed from euthanised animals, and 15 detached in the field; all of these broke at the weak link. Of the 15 detached collars, 10 dropped from live animals due to degradation between 106 and 208days (mean = 147 days) after deployment, four kangaroos were found dead and their collars were retrieved nearby and one dropped immediately after attachment. The performance of the device in this study demonstrates the utility of weak links as a cheap and simple remote detachment tool to prevent entanglement and achieve remote detachment of neck collars during animal tracking studies.";2025/02/21;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24018;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24018

Spatial mosaics of small animal communities across habitat and vegetation cover in semiarid Australia;['Shirley S. Chia', 'Keith Leggett', 'Lisa E. Schwanz'];The fluctuating environment of arid lands drives spatial and temporal variation in resource availability and habitat suitability for animals. Patches of vegetative growth may create refuges that allow populations to persist when resources are scarce. Yet the links between fine-scale spatial variation and animal abundance are not well known. Here, we examine whether spatial variation in habitat and microhabitat create spatial mosaics in animal abundance. We surveyed ground-dwelling vertebrates and invertebrates in two adjacent habitats in semiarid Australia (cracking clay floodplains and rocky gibber), and across variation in microhabitat (vegetation cover). There was considerable variation in vegetation cover, creating fine-scale spatial mosaics of microhabitats. However, animal community composition did not vary significantly across the two main habitats. At the microhabitat level, numbers of spiders and reptiles were positively associated with woody vegetation cover. Vegetation cover did not significantly impact other taxonomic groups or overall community composition. The results show that response to microhabitats by animal populations is taxon-specific. Woody shrubs may provide a more reliable or more detectable microhabitat refuge compared to grasses for particular taxa. Informed wildlife conservation in arid lands requires investigating taxon-specific habitat and microhabitat associations, as well as the scale and persistence of these associations.;2024/12/11;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24023;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24023
Spatiotemporal distribution of humpback whales off north-west Australia quantifying the Exmouth Gulf nursery area;['Kate R. Sprogis', 'Alicia L. Sutton', 'Micheline-Nicole M. Jenner', 'K. Curt S. Jenner'];Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) migrate from their Antarctic feeding grounds to their north-west Australian breeding grounds. North-west Australia has experienced rapid development of the mining and petroleum industry, and remains under increasing human pressure. The aim of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of humpback whales across the north-west: North West Cape, Pilbara and Exmouth Gulf. Aerial surveys (n=184) were conducted from 2000 to 2010. After accounting for survey effort, kernel density estimation was used to assess the monthly distribution of whales. The largest density hotspot of whale groups was the centre to western edge of Exmouth Gulf. The highest encounter rate of mother–calf pairs was in October in Exmouth Gulf (0.0447±0.0082groups/km), which was significantly higher than in the North West Cape and Pilbara (0.0005±0.0002 and 0.0011±0.0005groups/km, respectively). The comparison among the three regions confirms and quantifies Exmouth Gulf as an important nursery area for humpback whale mother–calf pairs. Nursery areas are important for lactating humpback whale mothers as they carry the highest energetic demands in the population. It is crucial that nursery areas remain relatively undisturbed from human pressures so mothers can rest to conserve energy and nurse their young.;2024/11/22;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24020;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24020

Mean minimum convex polygon (MCP) non-breeding season home range size of female goshawks was more than twice as large as the mean breeding season home range size. Home range size of males was similar in the breeding and non-breeding seasons and the MCP estimates suggest their home ranges are much larger than that of females. Tracked goshawks were range residents throughout the year with kernel density (KD) core areas centred on nest trees and preferred foraging locations. Movement patterns were highly recursive although some individuals occasionally undertook long range excursions away from their nests. Mean number of nests per goshawk breeding territory was 2.0 (range 1–6). Median distance between nests in breeding territories was 78.0m (range 1.8–915.0m). We recommend that prescriptive nest reserves for grey goshawks be implemented based on our 50%, 75% and 95% KD core area estimates for females in the breeding season. We provide a conceptualised example of a nest reserve design.;2025/03/14;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24025;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24025
Rocky landform specialists of the Mount Isa Inlier: camera trapping reveals seasonal occupancy and habitat associations of a unique faunal assemblage in an ancient landscape;['Jarrad C. Barnes', 'Elizabeth A. Brunton', 'Mark G. Sanders', 'Christofer J. Clemente'];Rocky landforms offer a complex and persistent habitat for a diverse range of fauna. The Mount Isa Inlier bioregion of north-west Queensland is dominated by such landforms, but the faunal assemblage inhabiting them has received scant attention. We conducted a 13-month camera trap study at 60 camera stations, totalling 21,965 camera days, aimed at detecting the faunal assemblage present on these landforms. We categorised each identified taxon as either a rocky landform specialist or non-specialist. We identified 15 specialists and implemented a multiseason community occupancy model for 12 of these to assess how they utilised rocky landforms over the course of a year, and according to a suite of environmental characteristics. Rates of use of rocky landforms increased in November and decreased in April. At the community level we found higher rates of use of south and west slopes than north slopes, higher rates of use of rocky hills than jumpups, and higher rates of use of metamorphic and igneous geologies than sedimentary ones. We provide the first evidence of this unique community’s use of the landscape through both space and time and highlight broad site characteristics of candidate areas in which to focus future management and conservation initiatives.;2025/03/03;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24030;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24030
Spatiotemporal distribution of humpback whales off north-west Australia quantifying the Exmouth Gulf nursery area;['Kate R. Sprogis', 'Alicia L. Sutton', 'Micheline-Nicole M. Jenner', 'K. Curt S. Jenner'];Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) migrate from their Antarctic feeding grounds to their north-west Australian breeding grounds. North-west Australia has experienced rapid development of the mining and petroleum industry, and remains under increasing human pressure. The aim of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of humpback whales across the north-west: North West Cape, Pilbara and Exmouth Gulf. Aerial surveys (n=184) were conducted from 2000 to 2010. After accounting for survey effort, kernel density estimation was used to assess the monthly distribution of whales. The largest density hotspot of whale groups was the centre to western edge of Exmouth Gulf. The highest encounter rate of mother–calf pairs was in October in Exmouth Gulf (0.0447±0.0082groups/km), which was significantly higher than in the North West Cape and Pilbara (0.0005±0.0002 and 0.0011±0.0005groups/km, respectively). The comparison among the three regions confirms and quantifies Exmouth Gulf as an important nursery area for humpback whale mother–calf pairs. Nursery areas are important for lactating humpback whale mothers as they carry the highest energetic demands in the population. It is crucial that nursery areas remain relatively undisturbed from human pressures so mothers can rest to conserve energy and nurse their young.;2024/11/22;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24020;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24020
A northernmost occurrence record of Shepherd’s beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi) – a molecular identification from Exmouth, Western Australia;['Melissa A. Millar', 'Kelly A. Waples', 'Holly C. Raudino', 'Kym Ottewell'];Shepherd’s beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi) is one of the least known beaked whales. Its distribution has been described as circumpolar, between latitudes 26°S and 50°S in the Southern Hemisphere based on scarce at-sea sightings and strandings. In March 2024, the remains of a cetacean were found in the Jurabi Coastal Park in North West Cape, Western Australia, 21°48′S, 114°06′E. Heavy predation on the carcass did not allow morphological identification. DNA sequencing was used to verify its identity as T. shepherdi, representing a 600km extension to the previous northernmost record for this species.;2025/03/17;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24033;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24033
Shedding light on predator detections: evaluating the impact of camera-trap flash type for feral cat monitoring through in-field observations;['Alexandra J. Paton', 'Jessie C. Buettel', 'Barry W. Brook'];White flash camera-traps are avoided in predator monitoring as they are assumed to lower redetection, despite infrared cameras producing lower-quality night images thus limiting the scope for individual identification and, consequently, the accuracy of density estimates. We sought to determine whether flash type impacts the behaviour of cats (Felis catus). We identified different behavioural responses exhibited by photographed cats, and quantitatively assessed relative activity, redetection rates, and the activity of specific individuals using 11,389 images of feral cats from 62 white flash and 62 infrared camera-traps across Tasmania. We found no difference in the relative activity of cats between flash types (odds ratio of 0.90, [null expectation=1], CI=0.55, 1.47), and there was no evidence of a reduction in redetection rate of feral cats following initial detection (odds ratio=0.83, CI=0.47, 1.46). The activity of individuals was similar between white flash (average=0.026, CI=0.021, 0.032), and infrared cameras (average=0.028, CI=0.022, 0.035). White flash cameras appear suitable for monitoring feral cats without resulting in a negative bias, highlighting the need for researchers to critically examine assumptions regarding best methodology.;2024/09/13;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24005;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24005
Determination of population age structure from the survivorship of individuals of unknown ages in unicorns and platypuses;['J. W. Macgregor', 'P. A. Fleming', 'O. Wade', 'R. Donaldson', 'K. S. Warren'];Population age structure is an important parameter for wildlife population modelling. However, for many species it is not possible to accurately assess the age of adult individuals. We present a hypothetical example to illustrate a previously described method of determining population age structure from the survivorship of individuals of unknown ages that to our knowledge is unused in the fields of zoology and ecology. We then apply this method to data collected over 10years for a population of wild platypuses (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), a species whose adult individuals cannot be accurately aged and for which only limited data on life history characteristics are available. Our results show a lower mortality rate over the first years of life of platypuses than the one previous study available for comparison, and suggested a Type I or Type III survivorship curve.;2025/03/28;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24027;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24027
Spatial mosaics of small animal communities across habitat and vegetation cover in semiarid Australia;['Shirley S. Chia', 'Keith Leggett', 'Lisa E. Schwanz'];The fluctuating environment of arid lands drives spatial and temporal variation in resource availability and habitat suitability for animals. Patches of vegetative growth may create refuges that allow populations to persist when resources are scarce. Yet the links between fine-scale spatial variation and animal abundance are not well known. Here, we examine whether spatial variation in habitat and microhabitat create spatial mosaics in animal abundance. We surveyed ground-dwelling vertebrates and invertebrates in two adjacent habitats in semiarid Australia (cracking clay floodplains and rocky gibber), and across variation in microhabitat (vegetation cover). There was considerable variation in vegetation cover, creating fine-scale spatial mosaics of microhabitats. However, animal community composition did not vary significantly across the two main habitats. At the microhabitat level, numbers of spiders and reptiles were positively associated with woody vegetation cover. Vegetation cover did not significantly impact other taxonomic groups or overall community composition. The results show that response to microhabitats by animal populations is taxon-specific. Woody shrubs may provide a more reliable or more detectable microhabitat refuge compared to grasses for particular taxa. Informed wildlife conservation in arid lands requires investigating taxon-specific habitat and microhabitat associations, as well as the scale and persistence of these associations.;2024/12/11;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24023;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24023
Pedipalp anatomy of the Australian black rock scorpion, Urodacus manicatus, with implications for functional morphology;['Russell D. C. Bicknell', 'Gregory D. Edgecombe', 'Christopher H. R. Goatley', 'Glen Charlton', 'John R. Paterson'];"Pedipalps – chelate ‘pincers’ as the second pair of prosomal appendages – are a striking feature of scorpions and are employed in varied biological functions. Despite the distinctive morphology and ecological importance of these appendages, their anatomy remains underexplored. To rectify this, we examined the pedipalps of the Australian black rock scorpion, Urodacus manicatus, using a multifaceted approach consisting of microcomputed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and live pinch force measurements. In doing so, we document the following aspects of the pedipalps: (1) the musculature in three dimensions; (2) the cuticular microstructure, focusing on the chelae (tibial and tarsal podomeres); (3) the elemental construction of the chelae teeth; and (4) the chelae pinch force. We recognise 25 muscle groups in U. manicatus pedipalps, substantially more than previously documented in scorpions. The cuticular microstructure – endo-, meso-, and exocuticle – of U. manicatus pedipalps is shown to be similar to other scorpions and that mesocuticle reinforces the chelae for predation and burrowing. Elemental mapping of the chelae teeth highlights enrichment in calcium, chlorine, nickel, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, vanadium, and zinc, with a marked lack of carbon. These elements reinforce the teeth, increasing robustness to better enable prey capture and incapacitation. Finally, the pinch force data demonstrate that U. manicatus can exert high pinch forces (4.1N), further highlighting the application of chelae in subduing prey, as opposed to holding prey for envenomation. We demonstrate that U. manicatus has an array of adaptions for functioning as a sit-and-wait predator that primarily uses highly reinforced chelae to process prey.";2024/05/13;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO23044;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO23044
An assessment of dingo ancestry in camp dogs in Western Australia;['T. L. Kreplins', 'D. Stephens', 'N. Laing', 'C. Oskam'];Hybridisation between Australian dingoes and domestic dogs is a controversial area of interest and research. An ongoing canine sterilisation programme in rural and remote Western Australia provided an opportunity to assess the dingo ancestry of camp dogs and opportunities for hybridisation. Blood samples were collected from 345 individual community dogs at 21 locations. Dogs were screened using 23 microsatellite loci and ancestry percentage assigned using an iterative Bayesian assignment algorithm. A single individual was a dingo, 96% were domestic dogs and 3.5% were hybrids. Camp dog and dingo hybridisation in these areas is of little concern in terms of conserving dingo purity.;2024/09/10;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24008;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24008
The reliability of latex weak links on radio collars used to track eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus);['Tian Chen', 'Naomi Davis', 'Pam Whiteley', 'Lee F. Skerratt', 'Charles El-Hage', 'Jasmin Hufschmid'];"Telemetry neck collars are commonly used to collect spatial data on free ranging animals. Two major challenges in application are entanglement prevention and retrieval of the collars after the study. Weak links made of a degradable material that breaks down while deployed on the animal are a potential solution to reduce entanglement and prevent the need to capture or sedate animals for retrieval. However, weak links can perform inconsistently depending on an animal’s behaviour and environmental factors such as heat and humidity. A study of disease in eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) in Victoria, Australia, provided an opportunity to test the performance of 35 radio collars fitted with a latex weak link between May and July 2022. At the conclusion of the study, 20 collars were manually removed from euthanised animals, and 15 detached in the field; all of these broke at the weak link. Of the 15 detached collars, 10 dropped from live animals due to degradation between 106 and 208days (mean = 147 days) after deployment, four kangaroos were found dead and their collars were retrieved nearby and one dropped immediately after attachment. The performance of the device in this study demonstrates the utility of weak links as a cheap and simple remote detachment tool to prevent entanglement and achieve remote detachment of neck collars during animal tracking studies.";2025/02/21;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24018;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24018
Population differentiation in the white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) at a continental scale: implications for dispersal, biogeography and conservation;['Richard E. Major', 'Georgina M. Schlub', 'Rebecca N. Johnson', 'Andrew G. King', 'Gretel S. Major'];The capacity for dispersal is an important determinant of a species’ resilience to decline from the serial extinction of local populations. Dispersal of animals can be difficult to measure directly but population genetics provides a powerful tool for identifying dispersal limits. This study used microsatellite markers to investigate population structuring of the white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) across its geographic range. Because the species is threatened in the north-eastern part of its range, the primary aim was to identify barriers limiting dispersal. Isolation by distance was not apparent across the 3000km mainland range but populations on three oceanic islands, and two mainland sites surrounded by urbanisation, were genetically distinct from each other and the other mainland sites. The small populations that were surrounded by urbanised land had significantly lower genetic diversity (allelic diversity and heterozygosity) than the other mainland populations, with the oceanic island populations showing intermediate levels of diversity. These results suggest that although being a partially nomadic species, which facilitates its dispersal over continuous habitat, the species does not have the flight capacity of some other small passerines and is sensitive to habitat discontinuity. Populations inhabiting small areas of coastal saltmarsh in areas with large human populations are likely to face increasing threat levels.;2025/03/07;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24037;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24037
Population structure, growth and reproduction in two species of Tympanocryptis (Agamidae);['Lyn Nelson', 'Paul D. Cooper'];Two threatened species of Tympanocryptis (T. lineata and T. osbornei) (the grassland earless dragon clade) are compared for population structure, growth and reproduction from sites around the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and near Cooma in New South Wales (NSW). Both species showed similar proportions of adults, intermediates and juveniles, as well as similar proportions of adult males and females. Growth patterns had a rapid increase in snout–vent length (SVL) in juveniles. Predicted adult SVL was the same in both species, and females in both species had greater SVL than males. In one year, the appearance of juveniles in the populations was later in T. osbornei than in T. lineata, but that may have been a result of cooler temperatures in the austral summer. Body condition was slightly better in adults of T. osbornei than T. lineata as the former were heavier and shorter. Longevity in the field was similar for both species, being slightly greater than two years, but reproduction may have occurred only once during their lifetime. Colouration associated with reproduction appeared to be the same for both species. Future work can use this information to determine how populations of Tympanocryptis sp. vary in response to environmental changes.;2025/05/01;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO24034;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO24034
Movements and habitat use of painted button-quail, Turnix varius, in tropical savanna of northern Queensland;['Patrick T. D. Webster', 'N. P. Leseberg', 'S. A. Murphy', 'J. E. M. Watson'];"Despite painted button-quail, Turnix varius, being one of Australia’s most common and widespread button-quail, knowledge of the species’ habitat use and movements is poor, and largely based on incidental observations. We GPS tracked eight painted button-quail individuals near Mareeba in northern Queensland during both dry (May to June 2020) and wet (January to February 2021) seasons. We found no evidence of nomadic or migratory movements; individuals occupied small home ranges (1.38–10.3ha) and the species was present year-round. Differences in home-range size were detected between sexes and between seasons, likely reflecting the species’ polyandrous mating system. In both wet and dry seasons, painted button-quail occupied open savanna with a groundcover of native perennial tussock grasses. The home ranges of all tracked birds were associated mostly with ridges and slopes, although some use of alluvial flats was observed. The presence of perennial tussock grasses was consistent across the areas used by tracked individuals. In contrast to anecdotal reports, painted button-quail utilised areas with open groundcover (as low as 5% groundcover vegetation) as well as areas of dense cover (95% groundcover vegetation). Given that this is the first GPS-based movement study of any button-quail species, our findings provide potentially important insights into the daily and annual movements of this cryptic genus.";2024/06/27;Australian Journal of Zoology;10.1071/ZO23039;https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/pdf/ZO23039
Navigating phylogenetic conflict and evolutionary inference in plants with target-capture data;['E. M. Joyce', 'A. N. Schmidt-Lebuhn', 'H. K. Orel', 'F. J. Nge', 'B. M. Anderson', 'T. A. Hammer', 'T. G. B. McLay'];Target capture has rapidly become a preferred approach for plant systematic and evolutionary research, marking a step change in the generation of data for phylogenetic inference. Although this advancement has facilitated the resolution of many relationships, phylogenetic conflict continues to be reported and is often attributed to genome duplication, reticulation, incomplete lineage sorting or rapid speciation – common processes in plant evolution. The proliferation of methods for analysing target-capture data in the presence of these processes can be overwhelming for many researchers, especially students. In this review, we break down the causes of conflict and guide researchers through a target-capture bioinformatic workflow, with a particular focus on robust phylogenetic inference in the presence of conflict. Through the workflow, we highlight key considerations for reducing artefactual conflict, managing paralogs and assessing conflict, and discuss current methods for investigating causes of conflict. Although we draw from examples in the Australian flora, this review is broadly relevant for any researcher working with target-capture data. We conclude that conflict is often inherent in plant phylogenomic datasets, and, although further methodological development is needed, when conflict is carefully investigated, target-capture data can provide unprecedented insight into the extraordinary evolutionary histories of plants.;2025/05/07;Australian Systematic Botany;10.1071/SB24011;https://www.publish.csiro.au/sb/pdf/SB24011

Morphological and molecular evidence for major re-circumscriptions in and eight new species of Melichrus R.Br. (Ericaceae subfam. Epacridoideae) in eastern Australia;['Helen T. Kennedy', 'Ian R. H. Telford', 'Darren Crayn', 'Jeremy J. Bruhl', 'Rose L. Andrew'];The genus Melichrus R.Br. has received very little taxonomic attention and treatments have largely disagreed on species delimitation. The eastern Australian clade of Melichrus was last revised in 1958. Over 60years later we present new, in-depth evidence for species delimitation. A morphological dataset (90 individuals from 68 populations, scored for 26 characters) was analysed using NMDS ordination with Bayesian Inference cluster modelling (mclust) and UPGMA hierarchical clustering to detect morphological discontinuities in the genus that may indicate species boundaries. Discontinuities in the morphological analyses were compared with those apparent in clustering (principal component analysis, SplitsTree Neighbour-Net, STRUCTURE and conStruct) and statistical analyses (HE, HO, FIS and FST) of a DArTseq SNP dataset of 548 samples from 110 populations of Melichrus. These new lines of evidence form the basis of detailed recommendations for a revised species taxonomy of Melichrus including the description of eight new species, recircumscription of previously described species and the correction of a longstanding nomenclatural misapplication.;2025/04/16;Australian Systematic Botany;10.1071/SB24031;https://www.publish.csiro.au/sb/pdf/SB24031
The Dicranemataceae (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta) revisited: molecular data indicate polyphyly in yet another wholly or primarily Australian endemic family;['Gerald T. Kraft', 'Gary W. Saunders'];The Dicranemataceae was monographed morphotaxonomically by Kraft in 1977, to which the four genera Dicranema Sond., Peltasta J.Agardh., Reptataxis Kraft and Tylotus J.Agardh were attributed. All, save for a species of Tylotus J.Agardh (from east Asia), were endemic to Australia. Additions (in 2006 and 2014 respectively) were the genus Pinnatiphycus N’Yeurt, Payri & P.W.Gabrielson from New Caledonia and Fiji and a new species of Tylotus from Hawaii. General features emphasised by Kraft were similarities of apical and internal structure, zonate tetrasporangia, monoecious gametophytes and placentate cystocarps. The genera did not show uniformity in regard to thallus habits and especially carposporophytes, however, the major differences of which were not accorded any family-level significance. Two later studies, N’Yeurt et al. in 2006 and Kraft et al. in 2014, presented limited molecular data but did not treat the family as a whole or fully resolve relationships between all of the taxa, leaving Kraft’s assumption that the family was monophyletic unchallenged. We address all of the genera, both anatomically and molecularly, and support proposal of two new families, the Peltastaceae and Tylotaceae, in addition to a monogeneric Dicranemataceae. A new genus and species of Peltastaceae, Peltastanomala virantra G.W.Saunders & Kraft, has unique axial and spermatangial anatomies and an unexpected family association with Peltasta. Two additional new genera and species (Chambersius thyrsus G.W.Saunders & Kraft and Huismanophycus marinus G.W.Saunders & Kraft) are even more dissimilar to Peltasta in habit and structure but weakly allied to the Peltastaceae on molecular evidence. Both are therefore regarded as incertae sedis.;2025/03/20;Australian Systematic Botany;10.1071/SB24030;https://www.publish.csiro.au/sb/pdf/SB24030
